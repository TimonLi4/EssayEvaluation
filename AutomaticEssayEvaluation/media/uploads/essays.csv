0,"Rica nu stia sa zica rau, ratusca, ramurica. I stared at the cracked ceiling of my 
bedroom in Romania, repeating the eight words under my breath. Rica nu stia sa zica 
rau, ratusca, ramurica. More than anything, I wanted to roll my r's, to speak Romanian 
without the telltale American accent. The simple exercise became a prayer. Rica nu stia 
sa zica rau, ratusca, ramurica. More than anything, I wanted to assimilate into the 
country that was my second home. 
My problems with identity probably sound familiar to many children of immigration. I felt 
most at home when surrounded by Romanians. I ate mici on the Fourth of July with 
Romanians. I met my best friend through the Romanian community. But when I spoke 
Romanian, I was something else: an American. I wanted to demolish that language 
barrier, to jump up and down on its remains, to destroy what marked me as an imposter, 
a pretender, a fake. 
Instead, I ran away. When my parents spoke to me in Romanian, I answered in English. 
When my friends called me a ""fake Romanian,"" I laughed. I chose to distance myself 
from my culture, and I made sure everyone was aware of that choice. But beneath the 
surface I felt adrift in a sea of ambiguous identity. I wanted to feel at home in two 
cultures; instead I felt like an outsider to both. 
About two years ago, I caught the baking bug. Starting out with pre-made mixes and 
rock-hard chocolate chip cookies, I worked my way up to custards, traybakes, and the 
occasional cake. I loved the methodical, precise nature of baking and came to 
appreciate the chemical underpinnings that made it possible. Though I did bake for 
myself, I baked mostly for others, revelling in the warm nods and crumb-filled smiles as 
people tasted the cake I'd spent the weekend making. 
As I started baking more on my own, I began leafing through old family recipes scrawled 
on yellowed scraps or typed up in long-forgotten emails. The aromas 
of cornulete, fursecuri, and saratele soon wafted through our house, evoking memories 
of summers long ago in our grandparent's apartments in Bucharest. The all-too-loud 
radio in Buni Doina's kitchen as she labored over prajituri de cirese. 
Plucking gogosi from the fryer with Buni's scoldings ringing in our ears. Watching Buni 
spoon generous amounts of honey and ground walnuts atop steaming mucenici. On 
some days, I imagined Buni's expert eye watching me stretch dough into clumsy figure 
eights, five thousand miles away. 
Buni's most important baking lesson, though, was not about moisture or 
measurements. Like me, Buni Doina can be overbearing at times, stubborn in the face 
of offered help, unyielding in her ways. But in the kitchen, dusted in powdered sugar, 
there is no denying her devotion to our happiness. Every stir of her wooden spoon is a 
step back to the common ground that unites us, fueled by constant, unrelenting 
affection. Her baking is not confined to an amalgamation of sugar, butter, and flour. It's 
an outstretched hand, an open invitation, a makeshift bridge thrown across the divides 
of age and culture. 
Thanks to Buni, the reason I bake has evolved. What started as stress relief is now a 
lifeline to my heritage, a language that allows me to communicate with my family in 
ways my tongue cannot. By rolling dough for saratele and crushing walnuts for 
cornulete, my baking speaks more fluently to my Romanian heritage than my broken 
Romanian ever could. Making my parents the desserts of their childhood, seeing their 
warm, nostalgic smiles as they taste that first bite of cremsnit, I reconnect to our family 
and culture. Through baking, I've come to see food not simply as sustenance, but as a 
universal language, a way to say the unspoken and voice the impossible."
1,"The only thing I associated with both Wisconsin the state and Wisconsin the university was 
cheese. For some irrational reason, I believed our campus tour would include shrines to 
cheese, statues of cheese, and endless cheese boutiques (is there such a thing?). In that 
respect, I was sorely disappointed. In every other respect, I was anything but. My mental 
checklist for colleges, after much condensing, contained three bullet points. Firstly, and 
most importantly, I wanted to go somewhere academically rigorous and research intensive, 
with innovative, dedicated professors and students as dedicated as I was. Secondly, I 
wanted a beautiful campus, to love where I would live for four years. And thirdly, I wanted 
to be happy. 
After seeing the towering monuments to research, the countless labs and classrooms and 
libraries, I knew, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that the University of Wisconsin was 
dedicated to providing its students with the best education possible, be it in the classroom 
or the lab. I knew my love for the molecular basis of life would be cultivated here like so 
many cell cultures. 
I remember boiling down cabbage with my dad to make acid/base indicators, talking in the 
car about the differences between branched and unbranched hydrocarbons in gasoline. In 
elementary school, my teacher wrote in my recommendation that I had been spending too 
much time reading animal books and too little time playing with other kids. I loved (and 
still love) all things living, often marvelling at the complexity of the animal kingdom, the 
human body, the organs, and the cells that were the foundation for everything else. The 
first time I read about the process of translation, of rendering mRNA into proteins, my eyes 
filled with tears; this is what I wanted to do, to apply the chemistry that had defined my 
childhood to my love of biology. 
The University of Wisconsin shares that passion, dedicating a plethora of resources, both 
intellectual and material, to its Biochemistry department. With technologies like biolayer 
interferometry, classes in the molecular control of metabolic disease, and distinguished 
professors, the University of Wisconsin Madison has everything any biochemistry 
undergraduate student would need, and much more. To research under a PI like Dr. 
Venturelli, listed among 33 other researchers as “the Future of Biochemistry” would be an 
unequalled opportunity, a dream fulfilled. Her work in drawing links between microbiome 
health and malnutrition in third-world countries does what the University of Wisconsin 
does best; making academic discoveries both relevant and essential in the real world. It is a 
culture I would be honored to take part in, should I be accepted. 
Although the University of Wisconsin Madison undoubtedly satisfied the first item on my 
mental list, I was sure my last two criteria would not go unmet. Located along the shore of 
Lake Manitoba and in walking distance of Madison, rated one of the best small cities in 
America by National Geographic, the University of Wisconsin Madison provides the ideal 
setting to learn, be challenged, and simply have fun. Walking by the lakefront with music 
playing in the background, I was sure that four years at the University of Wisconsin 
Madison would be challenging, but fun nonetheless. Our two tour guides embodied the 
Wisconsin spirit, recounting feeling the ground shake during “Jump around” and being 
pelted with snowballs after rushing Bascom Hill. Walking off of campus with my dad, salted 
caramel ice cream in hand (courtesy of “A Daily Scoop”), I felt a visceral sense of belonging, 
of knowing that this is where I wanted to learn and develop as a citizen of the world."
2,"I was 4. 
Blue blanket in one hand, cookie monster in the other, I stumbled down the steps to fill 
my sippy cup with coffee. My diplomatic self gulped down his caffeine while admiring his 
Harry Potter wands. My father and I watched the sunrise through the trees and 
windows. I cherished this small moment before my father left, disappearing in and out of 
my life at the wave of a wand, harassing my seemingly broken, but nevertheless, 
stronger, family. 
I was 10, and my relationship with coffee flourished as my father vanished. I admired 
the average, yet complex beverage and may have been the only ten-year-old to ask for 
a French-press for his birthday. Nonetheless, learning to craft intricate cups of coffee 
became my favorite pastime. I spent hours studying how to “bloom” the grounds in a 
Chemex or pour a swan. Each holiday, I would ask for an aeropress, an espresso 
machine. I became a coffee connoisseur, infinitely perfecting my own form of art. 
As the years went by--I was 11, 12, 13--I began to explore the cafes in Pittsburgh with 
my grandmother, capturing them through our shared love for photography. Coffee (one 
of the few positive memories I have of my father) is also the bridge that allows my 
grandmother and I to converge our distinctly different backgrounds into one harmonious 
relationship. Inside quaint coffee shops, we would discuss pop culture, fashion, and the 
meaning of life. We made it our mission to visit every cafe and document them not only 
through the camera lens, but also through the conversations we shared. 
I was 16 years old, and working at a family-owned coffee shop training other employees 
to pour latte art. Making coffee became an artistic outlet that I never had before. I 
always loved math, but once I explored the complexities of coffee, I began to delve into 
a more creative realm--photography and writing--and exposed myself to the arts--
something foreign and intriguing. 
When my father left and my world exploded, coffee remained a light amongst the 
darkness. As the steam permeates my nostrils and the bitterness tickles my tongue, I 
learn a little more about myself. The act of pouring water over grounds allows me to 
slow down time for a moment, and reflect upon my day, my life, my dreams, and my 
future. When I dive into a morning cup, I take a plunge into the sea of the self, and as I 
sip, am struck with the feeling that coffee is a universal link between cultures. I picture 
my great grandmother sitting on her front porch in Rome, slurping LaVazza and eating 
her coffee-soaked biscotti. Every cup takes me back to my heritage, forces me to reflect 
upon where I came from and where I must go, and who else, in another world, is sipping 
the same drink and reflecting upon the same principles. You see, coffee is like the 
ocean. It bridges two culture, two lands, two brains, all through conversation, exposure, 
exploration, but by one medium. I do not see it as simply a beverage, but rather, a 
vehicle for so much more. 
At 18, coffee is a part of who I am--humble, yet important, simple, yet complex, and 
rudimentary, yet developed. As I explore new coffee shops, I explore a new part of 
myself, one once hidden beneath the surface of my persona. My grandmother and I--we 
are conquistadors of the cafe scene, conquering the world one coffee shop at a time 
and, in the process, growing endlessly closer to each other and ourselves. Coffee has 
allowed our relationship to flourish into a perpetual story of exploration and self-
reflection. 
Now, I often think about my father and how someone whom I resent so much could 
have introduced me to something I love so much. It is crazy to think that it took losing 
him for me to find my true self."
3,"People love to ask why. Why do you wear a turban? Why do you have long hair? Why 
are you playing a guitar with only 3 strings and watching TV at 3 A.M.—where did you 
get that cat? Why won’t you go back to your country, you terrorist? My answer 
is…uncomfortable. Many truths of the world are uncomfortable. A couple of examples 
are that an equal number of pets are euthanized as are adopted each year and that cats 
roam the streets at night because they are actually looking for owners with better 
food. One of those statements is a horrible truth and the other is a thought I had in the 
shower. Either way, the point still stands. Uncomfortable truths are just that, 
uncomfortable. The answer to ‘Why won’t you go back to your country, you terrorist?’ is 
the most uncomfortable answer I can give, barring the current status of aboriginal street 
cats. 
Sikhs like myself have borne the brunt of the backlash through our forced subjection to 
hate crimes, bullying, and job discrimination. In [Date], a misguided gunman took the 
lives of six Sikhs who were praying peacefully in their house of worship in Oak Creek, 
Wisconsin. Their families, through their tears, asked the nation, like I continue to ask 
myself, “Why?” 
The uncomfortable truth is that as a society, we have not found a solution to the growing 
trend of extremism and hate crimes—we failed at the whole “freedom of religion” clause 
in the Bill of Rights. The media tells us that these crimes are carried out by individuals 
that are ignorant and motivated by hate. I would personally call them losers, but that 
would solve none of underlying system problems that have grown from anti-immigration 
rhetoric. When my cousin joined the US Army, he was told that he’d have to cut his 
beard and hair. Every time I tell that part of the story I can’t help but guffaw at how 
ridiculous it sounds. My then eleven-year-old angst came to a climactic fruition hearing 
those words—it was a call to action. 
I helped to gather signatures for a petition to Robert Gates, then Secretary of Defense, 
pleading with him to allow Sikhs to serve without having to cut our hair. We garnered 
over 15,000 signatories, receiving generous media attention. We called and convinced 
our local congressional offices to support this issue. I created a Facebook page to help 
spread awareness, and helped to organize fundraisers to help fight this ban on our 
articles of faith. Our message is simple. Through service, we can push back against 
both hate and intolerance. But, if the largest employer in the U.S. does not allow us to 
serve with our articles of faith, then we will continue to be victimized as outsiders, 
contrary to the founding principles of our nation. 
I’m proud to say my cousin deployed to Afghanistan as the first Sikh to be granted a 
religious waiver in nearly a generation. He saved countless lives as a doctor on the front 
lines of war and was awarded the Bronze Star Medal for his efforts. But, (there’s always 
a but) Sikhs today still face a presumptive ban. Despite being in perfect—for the army’s 
sake—physical condition, I cannot join the US Army because of my hair. 
So now the uncomfortable story that was the uncomfortable answer to an uncomfortable 
question comes to an uncomfortable ending. And, like all great uncomfortable answers, 
I never really answered the main question. I don’t have the answers to why people do 
the hateful things they do. But by wearing my turban proudly every morning, by 
answering questions when they come up, by being willing to talk about everything that is 
wrong, I become a personification of what is right. My solution to the systemic problem 
starts with me."
4,"The three, small, purple seeds sat on the brown soil. Ten feet from me I could see my 
grandpa with his yunta and donkeys. They were in unison: the two donkeys, the plow, 
and him. My grandpa commanded; the donkeys obeyed. I began to feel tired. 
Exhausted. My neck was being pierced by the Mexican sun as I dropped seeds for 
hours. 
I can’t complain; I wanted to do this. 
I placed three tiny seeds, imagining the corn stalk growing while the pumpkin vines 
wrapped around it; both sprouting, trying to bear fruit. I clenched a fistful of dirt and 
placed it on them. “Más,” my grandpa told me as he quickly flooded the seeds with life-
giving dirt. 
Covered. Completely trapped. 
My grandfather has been doing this ever since he was a little boy. Fifty-five years 
later and he still works hard on the field. There isn’t much else to do in the small town of 
Temalac, Guerrero. All he could do was adapt; something my parents never did. They 
sacrificed everything and left their home, never to return again. With no knowledge of 
what would come tomorrow, with only their clothes on their backs, they immigrated to 
the US. They had to work on unknown soil, hoping their dedication will help sprout the 
new seeds they’d soon plant. They did this for me. They wanted me to worry about my 
education, not if there would be enough rain to satisfy the thirst of the crops. 
I have a thirst. 
A thirst to be the vessel for my family into a better future. I must be the crop that feeds 
them. All these thoughts rushed into my soul as I looked back down the aluminum 
bucket. I could never be a farmer. I’m grateful my parents were. 
They planted a seed. A tiny seed with no instructions but to succeed. I’m the first-born 
son of two immigrant parents. I had a clean sheet to become anything. I could’ve fallen 
into my town’s influence, joined a gang, and become another statistic. Regardless of the 
dirt I come from, I began to sprout. Ever since I was eight years old I was entrusted with 
responsibilities. We were lucky that school was a three-minute walk; yet it was a 
stressful journey for a child. I had to wake up my brother, give him breakfast, make sure 
his clothes were ready, and that he was doing well in school. 
Growing up, I always fell behind in school. I had to take summer classes to match my 
peers’ intellect; while others were reading to learn, I was merely learning to read. My 
parents weren’t able to teach me English; I grew up solely developing my Spanish 
accent. My bilingual brain hadn't yet matured and lacked the English tongue. Entrusting 
a child to be the translator-of-all-matters for his parents robs him of his childhood. I had 
to help my parents navigate an English system unknown to them. From the day I 
learned to speak I had to learn to advocate not just for myself, but for my parents. 
I’m the type of person my family tree hasn’t seen. Staying in high school, getting good 
grades, and being a responsible individual are aspects that make people around me 
think that I have sprouted. But I have not yet bloomed into the being I wish to 
become. In fact, I have merely tunneled my roots onto the Earth; roots that have been 
solidified by the determination my parents instilled in me as a child. Nothing I ever 
accomplished was handed to me. It’s the fact that I have come this far without the 
advantages other students have that fills me with pride."
5,"I spent much of my childhood watching movies. I became absolutely engrossed in many 
different films, TV shows, and animations. From the movie theatres to the TV, I spent 
my hours enjoying the beauty of visual media. One place that was special to me was 
the car. My parents purchased a special screen that could be mounted on the back of 
the headrest, so that I could watch movies on trips. This benefited both parties, as I was 
occupied, and they had peace. Looking back, I realize this screen played a crucial role 
in my childhood. It was an integral part of many journeys. I remember taking a drive to 
Washington D.C, with my visiting relatives from Poland, and spending my time with my 
eyes on the screen. I remember packing up my possessions and moving to my current 
home from Queens, watching my cartoons the whole time. I can comfortably say that 
watching movies in the car has been an familiar anchor during times of change in my 
life. 
I used to watch many different cartoons, nature documentaries, and other products in 
the car, yet there has been one movie that I have rewatched constantly. It is called 
“Kiki’s Delivery Service” by Hayao Miyazaki. My parents picked it up at a garage sale 
one day, and I fell in love. The style of the animations were beautiful, and the 
captivating story of a thirteen year old witch leaving home really appealed to me. To be 
honest, the initial times I watched it, I didn’t fully understand the story but the magic and 
beauty just made me happy. Then, the more I watched it, I began to see that it was 
more about independence, including the need to get away from home and establish 
yourself as your own person. This mirrors how I felt during that period of my life,with 
mehaving a little rebellious streak; I didn’t agree with my parents on certain topics. That 
is not the end of the story though. As the years passed, and I watched it a couple more 
times, although with less frequency than before, my view of this movie evolved yet 
again. 
Instead of solely thinking about the need for independence, I began to think the movie 
was more about the balance of independence and reliance. In the movie, the girl finds 
herself struggling until she begins to accept help from others. Looking back, this also 
follows my own philosophy during this time. As I began to mature, I began to realize the 
value of family, and accept all the help I can get from them. I appreciate all the hard 
work they had done for me, and I recognize their experience in life and take advantage 
of it. I passed through my rebellious phase, and this reflected in my analysis of the 
movie. I believe that this is common, and if I look through the rest of my life I am sure I 
would find other similar examples of my thoughts evolving based on the stage in my life. 
This movie is one of the most important to me throughout my life."
6,"His eyes stared back at me with contentment. Neither he nor I, the baby girl on his lap, 
are smiling, but there is a sense of peace, of quiet happiness about us. I hold his wrist in 
one hand, my other grasping a bottle of ketchup. He holds my tiny leg and my waist, 
propping me up. His wedding band gleams in the midafternoon sunlight. 
That same ring catches the light in my bedroom, the bedroom he painted yellow when I 
was still the baby in the photo. My mother gave it to me for my sixteenth birthday, and it 
flashes purple when I move my hand. Staring at my reflection in the ring’s surface, I can 
still see the baby girl in the photo. I have the same round face, the same brown, 
almond-shaped eyes. For the first time, I have something tangible to remind me of him -
- something more substantial than our shared love of puns or 16-year-old photographs 
that curl at the corners. 
That picture has stayed the same for 16 years. My dad passed away before I took my 
first steps. I have no conscious memories of him. My mother did her best to make my 
childhood as normal as possible, but my dad’s loss still hurts. It is a strange feeling not 
to know what my own father’s favorite color was or what foods he liked. 
I was most fascinated by my mother’s stories of his career. Driven by a desire to 
emulate him, I decided I wanted to prosecute corporate tax fraud for the IRS, as he had 
done. If I was unable to know him, choosing his career path felt like the most substantial 
connection I had to him. I wanted to make him proud to be my father. 
For much of my life, my dad’s most discernible presence came through Social Security 
survivor benefits or checks from his pension fund, supporting our family and 
compensating for my mom’s sporadic employment. My health insurance was provided 
through Medicaid. These programs leveled the socioeconomic playing field so that my 
family had one less thing to worry about. So we could afford to focus our limited 
finances on things like extracurricular activities or saving money to further my education. 
Slowly, my desire to become an attorney became less about becoming my father. The 
older I have grown, the more I have realized the necessity of programs like Medicaid 
and Social Security, how changes in entitlement programs affect the everyday lives of 
Americans dependent on them: if Medicaid suffered cuts or my pediatrician’s accepted 
forms of insurance changed, I went months at a time unable to see a doctor. Through 
this experience, I discovered a passion for civil rights law. I want to aid others in danger 
of losing the same programs that have been instrumental to my success -- to help those 
that need additional advantages to gain the same opportunities as their peers. 
Even many of my close friends do not ask why I wear the same ring every day; I keep 
the story personal. Writing about my dad is difficult. I rarely talk about him with anyone, 
even my family. I prefer my ring to be a silent symbol of our relationship. Our connection 
is intimate, and sharing the ways that I feel his presence in my day-to-day life makes me 
feel exposed. I have never written in this much depth about the ways losing my dad has 
affected me. 
Addressing my greatest vulnerability has forced me to think about the example my dad 
set for me, despite being unable to play the role in my life he deserved. His legacy 
helped me form my greatest aspirations. Embodied in my story is the story of someone I 
barely remember, yet has inspired me more than anyone, someone who has given me 
so many traits that have made me the person I am today."
7,"Sliding the scottie dog across “Go!” past Boardwalk and Park Place, I immediately 
exhale. I am safe for another round; far more importantly, though, my younger brothers 
have not surpassed me. 
After passing by the weekend of “GO,” I begin the next lap around the board of 
challenge, success, and strategy. My next turn stops me at a chance card that 
reads: “Psychology project, physics assignment, and precalc test tomorrow. You will not 
be home from riding until 10 PM, but be at school at 6:30 a.m. for an NHS meeting. Go.” 
Solving for f’(x) atop a tack trunk in between riding my horses, Cinda and Coco, and 
writing about Milgram’s prison experiment by the light of my phone on the way back 
home, I’ve managed to make it through this round, but not before falling asleep, pencil 
in hand. 
My next turn is greeted with a bit more docility as I land on my brother’s property, and 
begrudgingly pay my rent of driving him to and from lacrosse practice. I return home to 
finish updating a client’s website, and complete my homework before re-organizing my 
closet to be sorted chromatically (I suppose I am the slightest bit type A...). Later, I pass 
out while on FaceTime with my bestfriend, Stephen, only to have a nightmare filled 
unsolvable physics problems: which way does the pulley go?! The world may never 
know! 
However, my next roll is not as kind: I land on the tile that reads “GO TO JAIL!” The 
night before the most important math test of the year, I discover that my dad, with whom 
I have a very distant relationship, has become homeless. Questioning what I was doing 
as I continued to study—and consuming an entire bag of jolly ranchers in the process—I 
remind myself that I cannot control what others around me choose to do. With luck on 
my side and doubles on the first role, I take the test the next day to discover I have 
studied all of the right problems and receive a 98%. I am still in the game for another 
turn. 
Feeling a bit weary from my last roll of the dice, I cross my fingers with the “FREE 
PARKING” square in sight. As luck has it, I smoothly glide past the hotels to have my 
best horse show yet- earning multiple wins against stiff competition and gaining points 
to qualify for five different national finals this year. 
The game of Monopoly runs parallel to my life in many ways. It is a game of strategy 
and precision, with a hint of luck and a tremendous amount of challenge. These factors 
result in a game filled with tests and questions around every corner, keeping me on my 
toes. Through good and bad “turns,” I have learned when to multitask and when to 
focus, when to take risks and when to play it safe, when to have a poker face and when 
to ask for help. Most importantly, I know that in moments of doubt or confusion, I can 
rise to the occasion. Whether I am faced with a befuddling essay prompt, a difficult 
course in the horse show ring, or even unfortunate decisions by people in my life, I 
know I can always attack any situation with confidence and vigor. 
As I embark on my next trip around the board, I reflect on the past properties I have 
purchased, taxes I have paid, and hotels I have built. Through the rounds I have played 
thus far, I learned how to deal with whatever numbers I roll and spaces I land on, 
whether that be “GO TO JAIL” or “FREE PARKING”. I pick up the chance card from my 
last turn with confidence: “Take what comes and enjoy the ride” I smile. I am ready."
8,"I have seen 2017’s Power Rangers exactly five times in theaters, and it was the best 50 
dollars I ever spent. 
There is nothing extraordinary about a movie filled with gaping plotholes, inconsistent 
writing, and cheesy cliches: what makes Power Rangers unique is its diversity. The 
content we consume should properly represent our world, and Power Rangers does just 
that. The film’s positive representation of marginalized groups is a stepping stone for 
Hollywood; four out of the five rangers are people of color, one is autistic, and another is 
queer. 
Power Rangers wasn’t the catalyst for my passion regarding diversity, but it 
demonstrates how eagerly I will consume anything with realistic representation. From as 
early as elementary school, I knew that, as an Asian girl coming home to watch the 
Disney Channel, there were few people who looked like me whom I could idolize. My 
white friends could relate to the shows’ families, yet my household customs never 
appeared on screen. The few Asians that did appear faded into the background, 
forgotten by the audience or reduced to racist caricatures. 
Ironically, I never realized the harmful effects of this erasure until I discovered proper 
Asian representation. Believing that my race made me inferior in our white-dominant 
society, I unconsciously succumbed to the “reserved and quiet” Asian 
stereotype, purposefully shying away from the spotlight. When I finally saw Asians as 
protagonists, my craving for diverse media grew, and I sought to learn as much about 
the importance of minority representation as I could. The countless TED talks and think 
pieces I discovered, which described the conundrum of marginalization I had 
encountered, helped me come to terms with the experience, and to recognize the need 
for change. 
Despite the contemporary push for female-driven narratives, I know that Hollywood’s 
fixation on “white as default” remains (Leia and Rey from Star Wars, Wonder Woman 
and Black Widow of DC and Marvel Comics). I know that when storylines showcasing 
cultures of color become popular, producers want to cast white actors for roles - even if 
whitewashed movies have collectively lost $500 million in revenue over the years. I 
know that LGBT characters of color are virtually nonexistent. I know that the problem 
extends beyond actors to people behind the scenes, that most scriptwriters, directors, 
authors, and producers are still straight white men. 
As someone whose identity has historically been ignored by the media, my existence is 
validated by the rare but increasing presence of Asians in books, movies and TV. 
Seeing Asian content creators use their platforms to talk about the importance of 
representation and their firsthand experiences in fighting bigotry inspires me, in turn, to 
engage in my own brand of activism. I’ve participated in a panel about race relations 
following a school incident in which we discussed topics ranging from the danger of 
whitewashing to living life as a minority - ideas I’ve pursued more intensely in my blog. 
Additionally, I co-founded my school’s first multimedia magazine in the hopes of offering 
others a means of self-expression. I continuously challenge myself to push past 
society’s ideals of what I can and cannot accomplish; by using my voice, I strive to 
educate others while simultaneously educating myself. 
With a college education, I hope to further explore the damaging psychological effects a 
lack of representation or, worse, erasure of representation can cause, and study ways 
to reverse or even prevent them. Most importantly, we must make it easier for 
marginalized groups to share their stories. After all, if more people start advocating for 
more diversity, positive representation will emerge - a recent example being Hidden 
Figures, whose empowering portrayal of black women was universally praised and 
inspired people everywhere. 
My race and gender will always play a huge part in who I am. So instead of letting the 
media dictate how people like me are perceived, I am ready to write my own narrative."
9,"Tulane University has a unique history, deeply established in the city it calls home, New 
Orleans. After transitioning from a medical school to a full college in in 1847, then 
undergoing a name change from the University of Louisiana to Tulane in 1884, as the 
city changed, Tulane changed with it. Tulane is the crossroad of two distinctly different 
ideals: being rooted in tradition and adapting to the needs of modern society. 
When the city was devastated by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Tulanians answered the 
call to serve. Scott S. Cowen, then-President of Tulane, refused to let the hurricane ruin 
Tulane and the CIty. Tulanians were part of rescue and clean-up teams, devoting time 
and resources to rebuilding their school and the city it calls home. What was most 
impressive, however, was their resilience. 
It would’ve been easy for the student body and staff to not come back. Being as smart 
and service-oriented as they are, the students and faculty could’ve found another place 
to live and learn easily. Yet, they returned. Tulanians have a certain sense of pride and 
commitment to the school that I admire. They could’ve stayed home and not gone back, 
but they wanted to pick up the pieces of the school they love. It’s clear that Tulanians 
take ownership in their education. I want to go to a school that my peers want to go to; I 
want to be immersed in a community as excited about being in it as I am. That’s Tulane. 
I could go on and on about Tulane’s teacher education program. I could write about how 
Tulane-educated teachers are leaders in their fields because they have both a degree in 
their area of study as well as certification to teach. Maybe I could mention the service 
learning requirements necessary to graduate and enter the teacher certification 
program, ensuring that the teachers are prepared to instill morals in the students that 
walk through their classroom door. 
Truthfully, I could go almost anywhere to become a teacher, but only schools like 
Tulane that synthesize in- and out-of-classroom learning produce great ones. Tulane, 
like I said before, houses a resilient and altruistic student body. They served New 
Orleans specifically in 2005, but Tulanians serve their community every single 
day. Newsweek ranked Tulane 19th for service-minded schools. Likewise, the U.S. 
News & World Report placed Tulane in the top 25 schools for service learning. It is one 
of the top schools for producing Peace Corps volunteers, a program that interested me 
for post-graduate work. 
Whether it is through Outreach Tulane, CACTUS, Wave of Green, or another similar 
program, I will be immersed in service work throughout my four years. Tulane stands 
alone in its commitment to community. Classroom education is married with service 
learning, producing empathetic, worldly leaders ready to set the world on fire. In my 
case, that will be through educating the next generation. 
I need a meaningful education to be a meaningful educator. Tulane is unparalleled in its 
dedication to development of the students, on a personal and intellectual level. From 
when I touch the Victory Bell after Convocation all the way to when I say farewell at the 
Wave Goodbye Party at Commencement, I’ll have changed and grown, both in my mind 
and in my heart. 
The Tulane study body is diverse and well-rounded; finding people and groups with 
shared interests is inevitable. I could see myself writing for the Hullabaloo or being a 
tutor in the After-School Newcomb Tutoring (which will bridge my learning and my 
intended career and give practical application to my education classes). But more so, I 
can just envision myself at Tulane, as a Tulanian. The willowing oak, myrtle, and 
cypress trees, the world-renowned research facilities, the dedicated faculty, the 
motivated and inspired student body, and the timeless school spirit all lend itself to a 
picture I can see myself in."
10,"I was thirteen sitting in my eighth grade geometry class, when I first heard of Fermat’s 
Last Theorem. We were discussing Pythagorean triples, whole number solutions to the 
Pythagorean Theorem, and conversation arose about the possibility of solving for 
exponents larger than two. What about three, four, or five? Eventually, this led to the 
teacher saying, “This is called Fermat’s Last Theorem. You won’t learn about it until you 
are much older.” With a dismissal like that, I naturally spent the whole night researching 
it instead of reading A Separate Peace for English. My fascination for this theorem was 
two-fold. The theorem is a seemingly simple concept, while on the other hand, it is 
notorious for being one of the most difficult proofs in all of mathematics. Fermat, 
himself, claimed he knew how to prove it, but promptly died leaving no evidence to back 
up his assertion. For over three and a half centuries, mathematicians were stumped by 
a seemingly impossible problem. Until it wasn’t. 
Fermat’s Last Theorem was the impossible math proof, but overtime, collective 
mathematical knowledge grew. In 1993, British mathematician Andrew Wiles combined 
others’ theorems and conjectures to show that Fermat’s Last Theorem was a special 
case of semi-elliptical curves and that the theorem was a modular form. As a result, 
Fermat’s Last Theorem was proven to be correct. Consequently, once the mathematical 
community reviewed Wiles’ proof, it was widely agreed that Fermat could not have 
proven the theorem, because the general mathematical understanding in 1637 was not 
developed enough yet. Though the story of its eventual solution is exhilarating, to me, 
this episode underscores a more important lesson that is as true in science and 
engineering as it is in mathematics: it is not through individual genius, but collective 
effort and exploration that impossible problems become solvable. 
Impossibilities surround us in the world. Here’s my impossibility—developing a solution 
to the global management of heart disease. Every year, millions die of cardiovascular 
complications, but nobody has a large-scale solution. My father’s death opened my 
eyes to the limited treatment options for cardiovascular disease, in that medicine can 
diagnose the disease, but current preventative measures are inefficient, as it is still the 
leading cause of death in America. Like Fermat’s Last Theorem, however, this problem 
does not have to remain unsolvable. Biomedical engineering applications enable us to 
foresee biological and physiological phenomena, and conceive system-oriented 
solutions to problems that have previously been treated symptomatically. I aspire to find 
new ways to track the growth of arterial plaque and blood clots throughout the body to 
better maintain blood flow, reducing, maybe someday eliminating, heart attacks, cardiac 
arrests, and strokes. 
I see Cornell as my next step towards accomplishing this aspiration. My brother, Matt, 
went to Cornell Engineering for his B.S. ([Date]) and M.S. ([Date]), and his 
accomplishments are what initially drew me to the College of Engineering. He was a 
member of the DARPA Robotics team that built an autonomous vehicle. Cornell’s 
theoretical approach to systems allowed him to find new ways of visualizing the world 
when solving problems. Although my brother and I have differing interests, I see through 
him how a Cornell education fosters a mindset not just to improve the status quo, but to 
reimagine it. 
Cornell researchers are already pioneering the future of cardiovascular 
engineering, where professors and students are researching “heart-assist technology” 
to discover better solutions to pediatric heart problems. That project is already seeking 
answers to many of the questions that motivate me, and I’m excited about the prospect 
of joining the effort. The college’s theoretical approach combined with its project teams 
offers a way for students like me to not just learn how to build things, but to understand 
the conceptual principles underlying each problem. With this two-pronged method, 
Cornell Engineering will allow me to solve my personal Fermat’s Last Theorem of 
developing better methods to combat heart disease."
11,"Step 1: Collect the ingredients 
On the Saturday before Chinese New Year, the kitchen counter is cleared of its usual cluttering 
of letters, cups, flowers, and brochures and replaced with flour, soy sauce, meat, celery, and 
spices. These are the telltale signs of dumpling making. 
Step 2: Marinate the meat 
The filling of the dumpling includes a mixture of different ingredients. I learned the importance of 
balance when I was in 7th grade. I had just transferred from a sixteen person private school to 
an 800 person public one, going from a school that was about 50% Asian to about 1%. I 
struggled with my identity, hiding my Chinese culture under a mask of normality. However, in my 
world history class, we started learning how each culture brings a particular perspective to the 
world. As I studied numerous different cultures, I slowly learned how to live as a daughter of 
Chinese immigrants and as an American citizen. I used my unique perspective, living at the 
edge of both cultures, to share my Chinese heritage with my peers. I opened myself to leading a 
balanced life—neither fully Chinese or American, but a little bit of both. Like the filling of a 
dumpling, balance is important in a fruitful life. 
Step 3: Wrap the dumplings 
The wrapper of the dumpling is the part that the world sees, but it is also the way a person sees 
the world. I have been privileged enough to travel around the globe, meeting people and 
learning about their cultures. I also have seen death and pain, and I recognize that they plague 
this world. When I traveled to New Mexico, I got to work with the Navajo and learn about their 
stories. I had the opportunity to talk to a lady in her late sixties. She had lost her son to a heart 
attack and her nephew to suicide a few months prior. Despite her struggles, she looked for the 
small blessings in life and remained hopeful. Her attitude encouraged me to do the same and 
look to the bright side of situations. Travel and knowledge have fueled a desire to help others 
around me. The wrapper of the dumpling is like the lenses someone wears when observing his 
surroundings. I have chosen to see others in a positive light. 
Step 4: Boil or pan-fry? 
Dumplings, like many Asian dishes, can be served different ways. The heated water necessary 
for boiling and the searing oil needed for frying represent the many different trials a person 
passes through. During my freshman year of high school, one of my closest friends started to 
shun me. I would pass every hurtful comment off as her response to puberty. I struggled alone 
for a long time, too ashamed of my weakness to cry for help. Cutting ties with her was hard; we 
had shared so many happy memories. The ordeal left me guarded. However, through 
taekwondo, I found my voice in teaching others, training them to respect and mentoring them 
through emotional trials that I could relate to. I also found strength in sharing my struggles, 
learning that weakness can be catalyzed into strength. Every trial and every triumph leave 
marks just like oil leaves a brownish burn on the dumplings and water leaves wrinkles. 
Step 5: Share and enjoy! 
Every dumpling is unique and so is every person. I am a dumpling that is still in the making. My 
experiences have added to my filling, fostering a heart for service and a mind open to new 
possibilities. They have shaped my wrapper, adjusting the lenses through which I see the world. 
My journey continues as I look down a new road, one that forks and turns with every 
decision. While the unknown may lead to fear, my previous struggles with balance and transition 
have taught me to embrace new challenges and allow them to shape me into a better, more 
flavorful dumpling."
12,"A cow gave birth and I watched. Staring from the window of our stopped car, I 
experienced two beginnings that day: the small bovine life and my future. Both emerged 
when I was only 10 years old and cruising along the twisting roads of rural Maryland. 
While my country-bound aunt and cousin were barely phased, the scene struck my 
young and sheltered eyes. Along with a whirlwind of emotions, the unrestrained act of 
parturition triggered a feeling of warmth I will never forget. 
Years later I learned in biology that all women are biologically nurturing, physically and 
emotionally. What did that mean? At that point in my life, I could truly make no 
connection. My idea of femininity was locked in what society had shown me thus far. 
Femininity was wearing dresses, applying makeup, cheerleading, and giggling near the 
most popular jock in the entire middle school. In other words, things I did not exactly 
partake in. 
But as I sat in the classroom, I didn’t think about my gender or how I relate to what 
society considers to be female. Rather, the discussion brought me back to that hot car, 
parked in front of that special birthing cow. I witnessed the essence of biological 
femininity as that cow radiated love and affection to her calf immediately after his arrival 
into the world. The cow represented the epitome of femininity: nurturement and 
selflessness. 
As I have considered the idea of “biological femininity”, I have for years questioned how 
I fit in with that term. Admittedly, I stray far from the stereotypical female. However, 
according to developmental neuroscience, evolutionary biology, and studies of sex-
based cognitive differences, I am empathetic and intuitive, and prefer language over 
logic— and that was all I needed. Through the birth of a calf, I realized that I did not 
need to be interested in “girl things” to be a girl. I did not need a characterized maternal 
figure to show me how to be a young lady. I certainly did not need a man to tell me how 
to be a woman. The qualities I possess internally give me all the femininity I need to be 
a female. There was no definition beyond that, nothing society could paint. That, I 
believed, was absolutely beautiful. 
The future is female. Now that I am beginning to understand the fluidity of 
femininity, hearing those words empowers me. There are endless ways to live the 
female experience, no one experience more valid than another. Creativity, intuition, 
kindness, and love are the roots of femininity, while whatever blooms is up to the 
individual. With my roots firmly planted, I only need the opportunity to grow to create my 
future. 
When I began thinking of a future field of study and career, I didn’t hesitate; I knew I 
wanted to work with women. After my struggle with femininity, nothing else intrigued me 
more. The birth of the cow seven years ago was my inciting incident. My story must 
include the love, warmth, and beauty of that day. To be a part of the birth story of others 
entering this world and to study the life and love that preceded is my goal. Eventually, 
through whatever it takes, I will become an OB/GYN so I can work with women daily, 
helping teenagers through puberty and educating on sexuality, supporting women 
through their personal challenges, and assisting in the life-changing act of childbirth. I 
am dedicated to the future of women. 
A cow gave birth and I watched. That experience helped me to become the powerful, 
strong-minded, and passionate young woman I am today. In pursuing a doctorate I 
hope to encourage and guide other women to be their own best self and show through 
my actions and story that there is no one version of womanhood that is “right”, perhaps 
influencing a new generation."
13,"Watching my coach demonstrate the drill, it seemed so simple. But when I tried to do 
the Carioca drill (it sounds like “karaoke”, but doesn’t involve wailing into a microphone - 
it’s more like shuffling sideways while doing the Irish jig), everything fell apart. 
Left foot back, right foot in front, left foot...where does it go again? Too late, I realized - I 
tripped over my feet and fell flat on my face as my teammates started laughing. “Saad, 
let’s see you dance again!” my teammate called out to me as we got ready to repeat the 
drill on the way back. 
Everyone grinned and watched in anticipation. I swallowed my pride and tried to 
Carioca in the other direction and stumbled yet again, as my teammates continued to 
laugh. “There’s no way I’m going to be able to do this drill”, I thought to myself. 
As the practices wore on, the drill changed. Instead of being called Cariocas, the 
drills were now named after me - “Saads”. Pretty ironic, right? At the start of every 
practice, I would try the Carioca like everybody else and miserably fail. I would stumble, 
or trip, or, worse, I would end up doing a full frontal. 
In order to avoid embarrassment, I began doing the drills as fast as possible. My “diving 
in head first” approach (literally and figuratively) definitely wasn’t working. Then at the 
start of the new season, I tried something different. As everyone quickly did the Carioca 
across the field, I slowly put each foot in front of the next. It was painstakingly slow, and 
everyone laughed as I practically crawled across the field. I began doing this every 
practice. It was a painful process - everyone laughed day after day as I tried to slowly 
work on perfecting Cariocas. With each practice, I got better. I gradually began 
stumbling over my own feet less. Until one day, I was doing them at full speed. 
I’ve become more flexible and quicker on my feet now that I can do Cariocas and It was 
like the pattern of the Cariocas, but instead of my feet, it was my mouth that made me 
afraid I would look clumsy. Like the Cariocas, avoiding or rushing through the problem 
wasn’t helping me. Instead, I practiced talking in front of stuffed animals, then in front of 
the mirror, and before I knew it, I was giving a presentation at a Future Business 
Leaders of America conference in front of judges who gave me great reviews. 
Other places off of the lacrosse field, I found myself stumbling there also – interacting 
with customers at Kohl’s or with patients at the hospital. Instead of tripping over my feet 
with customers, now working at Kohl’s I find myself being able to connect and assist 
customers much better – something that seemed so easy to do, but I always tried to 
rush through because of my fear of embarrassment. I had become a robot programmed 
to ask how someone's day was, instead of actually engaging and meeting new, 
interesting, complex people. 
Now, I can “Carioca” with them, as well as all of the patients at the hospital I volunteer 
at. I’ve stopped tripping over my own feet, and it’s led to me not being afraid to connect 
and interact with patients and customers or present in front of large crowds. Life is just 
one long Carioca – you might stumble at first, but if you keep pushing, the right feet will 
find themselves in the right place."
14,"Right, Up, Right inverted, Up inverted was what went through my mind when solving the 
Rubik’s cube. Years of solving the Rubik’s cube allowed me to hone my skills making the 
puzzle almost as easy as puzzles from my childhood. I remember when I first started 
tackling puzzles they were very simple. Word Searches were my favorite and I could do 
them for hours and hours. Once, I finished a whole book of them in only a few days because 
I had become so infatuated with them. I slowly made my way to harder puzzles and when I 
was in 5th grade, my aunt introduced me to a puzzle game on the Nintendo DS called 
Professor Layton and The Curious Village. I would play the game nonstop trying to solve all 
the puzzles the game had to offer and often, I would go past my bedtime. It was then that I 
knew I had a love for puzzles as it challenged my mind and forced me to think differently. 
My love for puzzles led me to buying a Rubik’s cube after I saw my friend solve his own. I 
bought my first Rubik’s cube in 7th grade and it had me perplexed . Learning how to solve a 
Rubik’s cube was, at the time, a tough challenge for me, as the Rubik’s cube can be mixed up 
to any of the 43,252,003,274,489,856,000 possible combinations. In the beginning, I was 
unable to follow the guide that came with the first Rubik’s cube I bought, but then I 
searched up a tutorial on YouTube and learned by watching. Utilizing my skill of memory, I 
was able to remember possible patterns that the Rubik’s cube could be after each step, and 
I was able to perform the correct algorithm to complete the step. 
After I learned how to solve a Rubik’s cube and learned that it could be solved many 
ways, it lead to me memorizing as many of the fifty-seven possible permutations of the 
third step, and all of the twenty-one permutations of the last step. I memorized the turns of 
each algorithm and visualized the process in my head, so I would be able to remember how 
to perform it. I never get tired of solving it, because there are so many combinations that 
every time I mix it up, there is a different solution. 
My outlook of the world changed, as I realized that there is not one concrete solution to 
everything, but multiple solutions. Being able to see things differently, the ways I solved 
some problems with multiple solutions were uncommon amongst my classmates. My 10th 
grade math teacher had acknowledged this when he wrote a comment on my test, saying 
he had not thought about solving a problem the way I had solved it. At that moment, I 
gained a new perspective in approaching the challenges of life. 
The little puzzles and obstacles that we encounter throughout our lifetime are preparation 
in order for us to solve the everlasting mystery of life, which is why I love all kind of 
puzzles. When I was younger, I faced one of these obstacles, which was the divorce of my 
parents. I wanted to know why my mother left and no longer lived in my house, but I was 
not able to understand exactly what had happened. 
Puzzles became my escape as I knew that all puzzles have an answer; they had 
unknowingly become a large part of my childhood as they made sense to me unlike what 
was going on in my life. Now I have come to see that life is a puzzle and that we must find 
the solution to it. Realizing that life is a puzzle in itself, I now openly accept and embrace 
the challenge of going through life with a new perspective, as I would any other puzzle."
15,"For my entire life, I have had the itch: the itch to understand. 
As a kid I was obsessed with a universe I knew nothing about. In elementary school, my 
favorite book was an introduction to fulcrums for kids. Like the Pythagoreans who had 
marveled at the perfect ratios of musical notes, I was enamored with the mathematical 
symmetries of fulcrums. The book inflamed my itch but I had no means to scratch it. 
I was raised a San Francisco Hippie by musicians and artists. I learned to sing the blues 
before I knew the words I used. Without guidance from any scientific role models, I 
never learned what it meant to do science, let alone differentiate science from science-
fiction. As a kid, it was obvious to me a flying car was equally as plausible as a man on 
the moon. When my parents told me my design for a helium filled broomstick would not 
fly, they could not explain why, they just knew it wouldn’t. My curiosity went unrewarded 
and I learned to silence my scientific mind to avoid the torture of my inability to scratch 
the itch. 
Then, in Sophomore year, I met Kikki. Before Kikki, “passion” was an intangible vocab 
term I had memorized. Ever since she lost her best friend to cancer in middle school, 
she had been using her pain to fuel her passion for fighting cancer. When you spoke to 
her about oncology, her eyes lit up, she bounced like a child, her voice raised an 
octave. She emanated raw, overwhelming passion. 
I wanted it. I was enviously watching another person scratch an itch I couldn’t. 
I was so desperate to feel the way Kikki did that I faked feeling passionate; AP Physics 
1 with Mr. Prothro had sparked my old Pythagorean wonder in mathematics so I latched 
on to physics as my new passion and whenever I talked about it, I made my eyes light 
up, made myself bounce like a child, purposefully raised my voice an octave. 
Slowly, my passion emerged from pretense and envy into reality. 
Without prompting, my eyes would light up, my heart would swell, and my mind would 
clear. One night, I was so exhilarated to start that night's problem set that I jumped out 
of my seat. I forgot to sit back down. I spent that night bent over at my desk, 
occasionally straightening out, walking around and visualising problems in my 
head. Five whiteboards now cover my walls and every night, I do my homework 
standing up. 
Once learning became my passion, my life changed. Old concepts gained new 
beauty, the blues became a powerful medium of expression. Mathematics became a 
language rather than a subject. I rocketed from the kid who cried in class while learning 
about negative numbers to one of two juniors in an 800-person class to skip directly into 
AP Physics C and AP Calculus BC. I founded [School] Physics Club, which became one 
of the largest clubs in the school. Over the summer at Stanford, I earned perfect marks 
in Ordinary Differential Equations, Energy Resources, an Introduction to MATLAB, and 
an environmental seminar, all the while completing the Summer Environment and Water 
Studies Intensive. Now in my senior year, I am earning my AS in Mathematics and 
Physics at the City College of San Francisco. 
As I enter college, the applicability of my field of physics offers me a broad array of high-
impact careers. Given that by 2050, 17% of Bangladesh's land will be underwater 
displacing twenty million people, I have settled on energy resources engineering. 
All of this is natural progression from one development - I learned to scratch my itch."
16,"As I left home last July to fly nearly 5,000 miles to summer camp in the Pacific 
Northwest, it felt easier than ever before. Not only had I made the trip each summer 
since the age of 12, but I had been newly promoted from camper to counselor-in-
training (CT), and the prospective change of role filled me with anticipation. 
My CT summer last year was by far my most memorable. I finally had the opportunity to 
impact the lives of the next generation of campers in the same way my own counselors 
had impacted mine; however, this chance was equally exhilarating and daunting. While 
it did motivate me to excel at my job and present the best of myself, it also made me 
increasingly aware of my perceived shortcomings, especially after witnessing many of 
my peers thrive in their new roles. One became a prominent and well-respected 
basketball coach, having played at an elite level all through high school, while another 
was especially gifted at looking after the youngest children, having helped her father 
raise her siblings back home. Compared to their successes, I struggled to maintain self-
confidence as I did not know if my effort was being equally well-received by the 
campers. 
However, one thing I was proud of by the midpoint of the session was the close 
friendship I had struck up and nurtured with one of the older campers while teaching his 
sailing class. This build up of trust culminated in him visiting my table one lunchtime and 
handing me a crumpled sliver of red paper, before scurrying away with a bashful grin. 
There is a strong tradition at camp of writing heartfelt letters to those for whom you are 
grateful, and this was one such note. Upon reading it that evening I collapsed onto my 
bunk, overcome with emotion. I lay there reflecting and reminiscing until late at night, 
before delicately tucking the paper into my journal. It detailed not only how I had greatly 
impacted and improved his camp experience, but that ‘I had become like a brother to 
him’, which I quote from the letter that is pinned to my bedroom wall even now. 
From that moment, my attitude for the rest of the session was markedly more confident, 
as I had received the assurance I was lacking. I channeled this confidence into 
teaching, working with the campers, and also into my personal relationships. After 
thanking my friend for the note, we further connected in an especially memorable 
conversation, where I shared some of my biggest fears surrounding 
loneliness, deteriorating friendships with my high school friends, and terrifying upcoming 
changes in my own life, such as moving abroad for college. In return, he entrusted me 
with his feelings about his troubled relationship with his parents and how that had 
affected his mental health, which he later admitted was the first time he had shared that. 
The assurance and confidence I gained from the summer did not desert me once I 
returned home. For one, the practical skills I had gained through counseling made my 
job as a diving coach far easier, as I had more experience teaching and thus better 
understood how to productively and positively interact with the young divers. However, 
the biggest change was in my attitude towards the future. While I confided in my friend 
about my fear of moving away from the familiarity of home during the summer, upon 
further consideration it no longer fills me with the same sort of 
apprehension. The confidence and maturity I nurtured while at camp will continue to 
serve me well as I move into the next stage of my life."
17,"An academic subject that inspires me is Computer Science. Computers have fascinated 
me ever since a young age. I used my first computer when I was 4 years old- the Apple 
Macintosh Performa. I began learning about how computers worked in first grade, 
where I had my own Windows XP computer. I did not know what I was doing when I 
clicked through the thousands of files that made the computer run, but it was 
fascinating, and almost seemed like magic. I knew that a career with computers had to 
be in my future. 
My fascination with computers took a new meaning in freshman year, when I decided to 
learn how to program. I did not know where to start, so I just typed in the search 
browser, ""how to start programming"". That day, I started with the Processing Language. 
It was a simple language to learn, but it built the foundation for my furthered interest in 
the computer programming aspect of Computer Science. After a couple months of using 
Processing, I learned HTML/CSS and JavaScript. These languages would allow me to 
program a wider range of applications. Soon enough, I became bilingual in the 
languages of computers. As time went on throughout my freshman and sophomore 
years I exposed myself to more languages like SQL, Batch Scripting, and in junior year, 
Java. 
In my junior year I took AP Computer Science A, and finally after all the years of loving 
computers, I was able to take Computer Science as a class where I learned the Java 
language. I also furthered my interest in Computer Science by integrating it with the 
Engineering club on campus, using the Arduino and Raspberry Pi. 
This year I am in Computer Integrated Manufacturing, where I can implement my 
knowledge of Computer Programming into Engineering, through the use of Corel Draw 
with the Laser Cutter Printer and AutoDesk Inventor and OpenGL C++ Code with the 
CAD 3-D Printing machine. 
Computer Science has always been a part of my life inside and outside of the 
classroom, and I seek to continue pursuing it as my major."
18,"I have always lived in the same neighborhood, in the same house, with the same bed 
but with an infinitely evolving atmosphere. My family started as my mom, my dad, my 
sister, and I. We did alright together--well, until my dad left for weeks at a time and 
eventually forever--but, let’s not get into that. 
Soon, my mother started her 12-hour/day job so I began to see her less, but my 
grandmother and I decided to cook together, become coffee connoisseurs, and develop 
our relationship. My sister and I grew closer than ever, and her friends became my 
friends. I decided to manifest my ideal life, starting with my relationships and education. 
Soon, I found myself surrounded by beautiful people and with an indefinite fuel for 
knowledge. It seemed as though one person leaving made room for more to enter. I 
think that this could be the essence of life--negatives leads to positives which lead to 
more negatives until negatives and positives are no longer discernible and there are 
only events. Events, however, are still striking and meaningful, no matter there 
connotation. 
Sure I have had some hard times, but, in reality, I have nothing to complain about. My 
life has been as tainted and beautiful as anyone else’s, full of average hardship and 
perpetual love. If nothing else, my experiences with my neighborhood, my grandmother, 
my education, and myself have taught me to squeeze the most out of every moment 
because memories last, but events always pass."
19,"“Ice cream Fridays!” “Two hours of recess!” 500 middle schoolers stood and cheered, 
pounding their feet on the bleachers. Declan was the popular star quarterback and my 
opponent for school president. He looked like an adult in a tailored suit, gesturing with 
his hands, never checking his notes, casting looks at the girls sitting in the front row. He 
had long wavy hair, a smooth complexion, and charisma. I sat in my polyester blue 
blazer and rumpled khakis. I was becoming more emasculated and filled with self-doubt 
with each chant. 
I had the best platform ideas and my aunt helped paint two dozen campaign posters. 
The year before, I carried the weight in student council while Declan skipped half our 
meetings. I was sure I could win. I clomped to the mic in my dad’s dress shoes. I read 
my long speech from my notes without enthusiasm. My only applause came from a 
couple of friends who felt bad for me. 
Later, in high school, math and programming made sense to me — people didn’t. At a 
Model UN meeting, confident upperclassmen talked about the power of persuasion and 
public speaking. I felt like I didn’t belong, but their command of the stage made me want 
to be a part of it. At my first conference, representing Brazil’s humanitarian policies, I 
had developed what I thought was a brilliant proposal. I was confident and was the first 
to raise my placard. I had so many ideas but when I took the mic, I didn’t know where to 
start. I rambled on about background and never got to my main points. I felt foolish for 
thinking I was going to be so effective. My highwater pants and my sleeves hanging 
over my fingers added to my insecurity. 
I continued this pattern of my speaking skills not matching my confidence in the quality 
of my ideas. To compensate, I increased the intensity of my preparation. I’d fill a binder 
with hundreds of research documents, I immersed myself in my roles. I mistakenly 
assumed that good ideas alone would be enough to win. At one conference, two 
delegates asked me to join their bloc to get access to my ideas with no intention of 
giving me a meaningful role. They saw me purely as a policy wonk. 
My fascination with geopolitical and economic issues were what kept me committed to 
MUN. But by the end of sophomore year, the co-presidents were fed up. “Henry, we 
know how hard you try, but there are only so many spots for each conference...” said 
one. “You’re wasting space, you should quit,” said the other. 
Nevertheless, I persisted. My junior year I ran for club secretary. Automating attendance 
and quantitative projects were my inclination. But members saw me as a younger, less 
intimidating officer, and started coming to me for guidance. When Gabby, a freshman, 
came to me for advice, I tried to pass her off to the co-presidents. She was terrified of 
speaking at conferences, and I didn’t know how to express my empathy. “They aren’t 
going to take me seriously, I don’t have charisma, I’m too short!” I saw my own 
insecurities in her. I didn’t feel like I was qualified to help, but I reminded her of the 
passion she had shown in meetings. Gradually, I became a mentor to her and many 
others. I was enjoying supporting them and was gratified by guiding their growth as 
delegates. One sophomore even anointed me “MUN soccer mom.” 
On the bus to her first conference, Gabby was in a panic, but throughout the day I saw 
her confidence grow. When she won Outstanding Delegate, beyond anyone’s 
expectations, our whole row erupted in wild cheers. When my name was also called 
shortly after, it felt anticlimactic. I was far more proud of succeeding in my new role as a 
mentor than I was of my own award."
20,"One in three victims of a heart attack don’t show any symptoms before it happens. 
Ninety-five percent of cardiac arrests that occur outside a hospital are fatal. These are 
not merely statistics. A heart attack redefined my life on November 21st, [Date]. 
It was a warm autumn morning, and I was raking leaves with my Boy Scout Troop to 
fundraise for our high adventure patrol’s 50-mile hike to summit Mt. Washington in New 
Hampshire. I had left my house on my bike early, without telling my mom—she was 
asleep, and my dad was at work. 
About an hour into raking, I saw my mother park nearby, and braced myself for a lecture 
about how my absence had freaked her out. No part of me imagined why she was 
actually there. Two words, delivered with the force of a Mack truck, “Dad died.” That 
morning on his routine break, his cardiac arteries became terminally obstructed. A heart 
attack and subsequent cardiac arrest ensued. That was it. No goodbye, no I love you, 
none of that. 
From there, my mind spiraled downward into an emotional void. I began to question my 
entire life—and how my father played into it. What did I last say to him? Did he know 
how much I loved him? I wanted to pinch myself and end the nightmare. But no, it was 
real life. In the subsequent weeks, there was no clarity or closure. The path I was 
travelling on was engulfed by thick fog. I questioned everything about life as I knew it: 
why do bad things happen to good people?—what does life mean?—how can I move 
forward?—how can the universe be so cruel? Three years later, I’m still searching for 
answers. 
My father was wise, reserved, hardworking, and above all, caring. I idolized his humility 
and pragmatism, and I cherish it today. But after his death, I was emotionally raw. I 
could barely get through class without staving off a breakdown. 
Looking at my reflection in my dresser mirror one afternoon, I was examining my 
bloodshot, teary eyes when I noticed an old sticker of a black and white eye. When I 
was ten or eleven, I had gotten into trouble for playing video games too much, cursing, 
or some other youthful infraction. I was in my room as punishment after being scolded, 
when my dad came in. He placed this simple sticker on the mirror, and said, “Just 
remember, I’m always watching over you, no matter where I am.” When this happened, 
I knew he was being contextual about making sure I didn’t misbehave—but after his 
death, it seemed so omniscient and transcendental. When I look at that sticker, I know 
he’s with me. 
One of my dad’s favorite adages was, “If you really think you’re doing your best—and 
it’s still not enough—make your best better.” When he would scold me about my grades, 
I always thought he was just being a “stickler,” demanding perfection. I know now that 
he was just encouraging me to do and be my best. His words have become my credo. 
During the entire year after his death, there were more than a few “firsts without dad”—
first Christmas, first birthday, first Father’s Day, but also the first time I truly motivated 
myself. I think of my dad often, but never more than when I am pushing myself to 
succeed. 
One in three victims are unaware they’re about to have a heart attack? Ninety five 
percent of cardiac arrest victims die? These statistics are just not good enough for me. 
As my dad would say, it’s time to make our best better to combat heart disease. My 
father is more than a statistic. His wisdom lives within me. When I face life’s obstacles, I 
know I can conquer them with him on my side."
21,"As I sat alone in a crowded airport, I felt both excitement and nervousness. I took my laptop 
and opened it to the Facebook profile of my third cousin Joey. I remembered how curious I 
was the first time I learned about his existence. He seemed just like me. I could not have 
been more excited, for I was on my way to New Jersey to spend spring break at his parents’ 
house. 
It may seem strange that I was so eager to meet a third cousin, as most Americans have 
minimal contact with relatives as distant as third cousins. Meeting distant relatives meant 
expanding the family tree, forming new connections, and expanding support networks. 
Setting down new roots by travelling to New Jersey to meet Joey not only felt right but also 
necessary. 
After landing and meeting Joey and his mom Alla, I felt awkward; we had absolutely 
nothing to discuss. Maybe visiting people I have never met was a mistake. 
That night Alla explained to me that partner dominos was a family tradition dating back 50 
years in the Soviet Union. I had never played dominos with a partner. Absolutely stunned, 
Alla cried, “YOU HAVE NEVER PLAYED PARTNER DOMINOS? HOW THE HELL IS YOUR 
MOTHER RAISING YOU?” The rest of the night we played partner dominos, and let me 
admit, I was awful. Nevertheless, I experienced a strong sense of belonging and connection 
to my heritage by taking part in an old family tradition. That game broke the ice and made 
me realize that we share a cultural and personal connection; starting with that game, I 
actually felt like we were family members. Unsure of what else my mom had neglected, Alla 
inundated me with an entire rundown of my extended family. I learned that I could travel 
to almost every continent, knowing there would always be someone to whom I am related. 
Due to my family’s Russian heritage, I would always be welcome, adept at partner dominos 
or not. 
A week later when I sat waiting for my flight home, I smiled. People whom I had just met, 
who had their own busy lives to live, took me in and made me feel welcome. At the end of 
the visit, I felt as if I had known Joey and Alla my entire life. I had to acknowledge that I had 
underestimated the need for extended family in my life. Furthermore, as I contemplated 
the transition from stranger to family member, my mind took me further to 
comprehend that whether related or not, I would live a more fulfilling life if willing to make 
vital connections. I consider every person with whom I forge a connection part of my 
“family” network, regardless of how remote. Though I had thought of “family” as merely a 
support system, I realized now that it is comprised of the people who, through powerful 
shared experiences, help one find a place in the world. 
When I launch into the next phase of my life, I am hoping to forge relationships with 
roommates, classmates, and professors. As a global citizen, I am also dedicated to connect 
with others and help them find a place in this world, just like Alla and Joey did for me."
22,"From an early age I became a translator for my mother anytime we went out in public. 
This experience forced me to have conversations with adults from a young age. It made 
me become a great communicator, while helping my parents overcome their language 
barrier. 
Being a communicator has allowed me to lead. When I joined my school’s National 
Honor Society I was given the opportunity to lead. Applying the skills I used from being 
my mother’s translator I was able to do what no one else could, make the calls and start 
the club’s most successful event to date an annual Food Drive at a local Albertson’s, 
which collects over one ton of food every November. Also developing events like an egg 
hunt at the local elementary school, a goods drive for the Children’s Hospital of Los 
Angeles, and stabilizing a volunteer partnership with a local park. I have been able to 
grow as a leader, who actively communicates and brings parties together, planning 
events and having them run smoothly with minor issues. For instance, last year there 
was an issue with the homeless shelter not picking up the food for the food drive. In a 
spur of the moment solution I managed for club member’s parents to collectively deliver 
the food. My ability to communicate benefited me allowing me to find a solution to an 
unanticipated problem. 
Throughout the four years I have been in journalism I have led; mentoring younger 
writers and improving the way the paper operates. Staying after hours, skyping with 
writers about their articles all helped establish my role as a leader, who is always 
supporting his team. I have done this while writing over 100 articles, editing tons of 
pages, and managing deadlines. I learned that while being a leader requires effort, it is 
the passion like I have for journalism that motivates me to lead in my community. 
Being a leader so far in my life has taught me that I need to communicate, be 
passionate, and pass on my knowledge helping cultivate future leaders, who can 
expand and supersede my work."
23,"“How do you keep going after days like this?” a tear-stricken woman asked me after 
watching me put all my effort into attempting to resuscitate her husband after he 
had committed suicide. I‘ve grappled with my answer to her question for many years, 
but I may finally have one. 
I wish I could truthfully say that I have grown accustomed to the catastrophic calls. I 
wish I could say the weight of the words “I’m sorry for your loss” lessens after saying 
them countless times to heartbroken families. But that is not the reality. 
“Days like this” come often in emergency medicine; people call 911 on the worst day of 
their lives, when their baby stops breathing or their loved one suddenly collapses. Being 
one of the youngest medical responders ever certified in [Location], I have spent the 
majority of my adolescence running toward car crashes, flaming buildings, and into 
ditches while most sane people bolt in the opposite direction. While I am no stranger to 
cardiac arrest, severed limbs, and failing organs, it isn’t the mutilated patients that stand 
out in my memory, but the moments when I get a pulse back during CPR, the hugs from 
grateful family members, and the few, but treasured “thank you’s.” 
This steel box that flies down the road at seventy miles per hour is where I grew up, 
where I fell in love with emergency medicine. It was a whole new world of insatiable 
curiosity and gut-wrenching adrenaline; where I became fascinated by the actions 
of presents a new puzzle—a new person to heal. 
I never knew I had the courage to talk a suicidal sixteen-year-old boy down from the 
edge of a bridge, knowing that he could jump and take his life at any moment. 
I never knew I had the strength to hold the hand of a dying man encased in the 
wreckage of his car while he spoke his last words to me. 
I never knew I had the confidence to stand my ground and defend my treatment plan to 
those who saw me as less than capable because of my age or gender. 
The emergency services brought me to places that I never could have imagined and 
introduced me to patients and people who broadened my worldview. I found myself in 
frigid rivers pulling unresponsive people into boats and laughing at the incredible sense 
of humor of a homeless man. It didn’t matter where people came from or who they were 
when they were on my stretcher, socioeconomic status and labels fell away. Whether I 
was performing CPR or helping a frail old woman off her kitchen floor, I knew I was 
changing a stranger’s life even if all I could offer was a hand to hold. 
I have an innate passion to heal. I am continuously enthralled by the complexity and 
endless beauty of the human body and I could spend my whole life studying it, but I will 
only scrape the surface of its wonders. I could engineer cells to produce missing 
proteins; I could grow stem cell hearts, livers, and kidneys; I could create tumor 
destroying medications; I can heal people one person at a time until I help eliminate the 
word ‘incurable’ from the dictionary. I answer that catastrophic call day after day 
because to love medicine is to love humanity and no one has ever really lived until they 
have done something for someone who can never repay them."
24,"Video games have cultivated my creative thought process. When I was a toddler I 
invented a game I would play with my brothers. It was nothing along the lines of Hide-
and-Seek or Tag, but rather, it was meant to mimic a role-playing video game. It was 
called ""Guy"" and came with its own story, leveling system, and narrative story. While 
seemingly impossible to translate the mechanics of a video game into real life, the 
""Guy"" trilogy provided hundreds of hours of fun to pass hot summer days and escape 
the harsh reality of our parents arguing and eventual divorce. 
This thought process translated into my educational career. have always thought of a 
tough class or test as a video game. This mostly due to my excessive amounts of video 
games I played as a child through middle school (especially 7th grade). Each year 
comes bigger and ""stronger"" challenges, bigger and stronger bosses to defeat. My 
senior year will have me face the most powerful boss yet; full AP course load on top of 
heavy club involvement and community college classes. 
Many thought of this ""secret boss"" as an impossible challenge; something that could 
never be beaten. No one from my school has ever attempted to take on such a 
challenge, let alone defeat it. That is probably what excites me about it. In a game, 
messing around with lower level enemies is fun for a while, but gets boring when it is 
too easy. The thought of a challenge so great and difficult makes the victory even more 
rewarding. Stormy skies, heavy rain, and epic boss battle music; I'll take that over a 
peaceful village any day. In the future, I seek to use this thinking to drive research. I 
think of abstract physics concepts like secret door and levels that need to be proven 
true or just a myth in the game. One day, I can make my own discovery of a secret 
""cheat code' that can help everyone who plays a little game called life."
25,"First impressions are everything—even in kindergarten. 
I was born with Nonsyndromic Aplasia Cutis Congenita. Basically, I have had a scar on 
my head since birth, and hair couldn't always grow over it. Up until fourth grade, when I 
underwent two hair transplants that would allow me to slowly grow hair over my scar, it 
was definitely noticeable. 
What I remember vividly about kindergarten is my new peers glaring at my shiny head 
with a puzzled look. I learned about my classmates through their lunchbox covers and 
backpack designs; they saw me as the boy with the scar. 
It had a nice ring to it, but I wasn’t a fan. Unfortunately, that’s what I imagined everyone 
saw first, and first impressions stick. 
In elementary school, it was still my defining characteristic—what separated me from 
a sea of collared t-shirts and cargo shorts. As I began first grade, the questions 
started. In retrospect, they were harmless, but they made me feel alienated. I would try 
to shrug them off, but the benign inquisitions furthered the self-created idea that I was 
different than my classmates because of something I couldn’t fix. 
The idea of my peers seeing only my bare scalp when they looked at me, whether true 
or not, was a nightmare I couldn’t shake. It was my most distinct feature, but I didn’t 
want it to be defining. So, I applied myself to my activities. No matter what it was, I 
always tried to stand out so I wouldn’t be seen as the boy with the scar anymore. My 
hair wasn’t something I could control, but my personality was. I wanted to build an 
identity on my interests and attributes, not have one automatically assigned because of 
a birth mark. 
From art to sports to being one of the only first graders on elementary student council, 
my desire to distract my peers from my scar was the reason I pushed myself to try new 
things and work at them, even if it wasn’t for the best reason. 
As I grew up with it and found hobbies that I genuinely enjoyed doing and talking about, 
I slowly became more comfortable with the attention that I once shied away from. I 
found a way, through my activities and interests, to feel comfortable in my skin, whether 
there was hair on it or not. 
I remember walking out of the operating room after my second surgery with a new 
sense of self, ready to be a different person with a re-created identity and a full head of 
hair. That didn’t happen. I went back to school as the same person I was before, and 
that was exactly what I wanted—I just didn’t know it then. For so long I felt restricted by 
my scar. It wasn’t until hair started growing when I realized I never really was. 
I didn’t have a sudden epiphany about my scar after the surgery, nor did I feel like a 
new person. By that point in my life, I had figuratively grown into my scar just as I grew 
into my brother’s hand-me-downs. I found and focused on my interests, and from them I 
developed an identity that I was proud of, well before I went under the knife. 
A caveat of my surgery was that the hair would grow, then one-third would fall off. My 
scar will never be completely gone, but I no longer feel defined by it like I did in 
elementary school. 
Neither the surgeries or my search for a more redeeming quality completely changed 
my life, but both experiences made me more confident in my self-perception. I can be 
whatever I want to be; a scar can’t change that. It just took two surgeries and years of 
nail biting and pushing myself at my activities, some of which I still partake in and am 
passionate about today, to realize it."
26,"Piano Man plays on repeat in Used To Be’s Island Eatery, a high-volume bar and 
restaurant in the town of [Location] on the Jersey shore. Balding men and blonde 
women sway to the song as they sit on the wooden barstools, chatting and laughing 
about their lives. 
From my hostess stand I can see it all. To my left is the restaurant portion of the 
building. It is dimly lit but there is enough light to see the customers’ expressions, from 
the time I seat them until their plates have been cleared. It’s fascinating to watch how 
much people change from the time they approach me at the stand, hungry and 
impatient, to when they are smiling and telling me to have a good night, plucking a mint 
from the silver bowl as they leave. 
I’ve learned that the demeanors of the staff shape the mood of the restaurant. When the 
waitresses have come from the beach and have plans with their friends later that night, 
there is a sense of calmness and ease among the staff and the customers. On the other 
hand, when one waitress trudges in fifteen minutes late on a rainy afternoon and recites 
her endless list of the day’s unfortunate experiences, the entire mood drops. I’ve 
discovered that restaurants are all about putting on a happy face, even if you’re secretly 
envisioning hurling a rude customer's plate across the restaurant like a frisbee and 
watching ravioli spray across the room. 
My dad has always told me to be positive, but I never really understood how truly 
meaningful that was until I started working as a host. I’ve learned that positivity and 
friendliness are crucial to making any situation more enjoyable, and especially in 
making stressful ones more bearable. So, even if I have eighteen reservations and a 
dozen takeout orders to handle, I plant a smile on my face and ask the elderly couple 
that walks in the door how they are doing. What I’ve discovered is that when they smile 
back at me and ask me about myself, it brightens my mood, and I end up having a 
simple and sweet conversation with complete strangers. Their kindness is uplifting, and 
I love hearing about a couple’s recent vacation, or talking and laughing with the father of 
a baby who just tried to eat a lemon. 
I was anxious about starting my first job. However, I quickly found that hosting not only 
suited my strengths, but also taught me more about myself and how others behave in 
stressful environments. Hosting requires perception, observation and organization, 
qualities that play to my strengths. While the waitresses are distracted taking orders or 
bringing food, I’m the one who watches over the entire restaurant, making sure that 
tables are cleaned and little kids have paper and crayons. On the other hand, this job 
also taught me that sometimes I need to keep my mouth shut and deal with issues on 
my own, even if it means defusing an uncomfortable conversation with a customer who 
has had too much to drink. This response is generally counterintuitive to what I’ve been 
taught in school, which is to speak up and seek help from peers or teachers. In this 
business, one is often told to “figure it out yourself” or “just fix it”. Initially this was 
challenging, but I soon discovered that it taught me to have faith in myself and be more 
independent. 
I absolutely loved this job. I discovered how much I enjoy working with and learning 
from other people. Hosting taught me the value of being totally engaged and fully 
present, which allowed me to commit myself to the people and environment around me. 
This job took me out of my comfort zone, but I have no doubt that what I learned will 
help me in every stage of my life, including when I go back next summer."
27,"The initial sound of a distant ambulance didn’t cause my grandmother any worry as she 
relaxed and looked out over Eagle Lake in Acadia State Park. She only started to take notice 
when the third ambulance urgently made its way into the mountains behind them, causing 
her and her best friend to sit up from their beach chairs. They had been enjoying the 
afternoon on the beach while my grandfather and his best friend had gone hiking on the 
popular yet daunting Beehive Loop Trail. Both men were in excellent shape and often 
found themselves hiking alongside one another. 
My grandmother’s concern faded rather quickly as sirens fell distant and time passed. 
After about 30 minutes, my grandfather’s friend ran toward the beach. My grandfather was 
not next to him. He was not there at all. At that moment, my grandma knew. 
“Burt...he was with me...he slipped...he fell...I ran down the side of the mountain, off the 
trail, but I couldn’t find him. The park rangers are looking...” She stopped listening. She 
could see his lips moving, yet she heard nothing. 
My grandfather died that day. As he was only about 5 minutes from the top of the 
mountain, he lost his balance on a particularly difficult section of the trail and fell over 100 
feet. A freak accident. One that could never have been imagined or anticipated. A horrific 
event which brutalized a man and a family which had been nothing but good to the world. 
I never knew my grandfather. He died only 80 days before I was born. But I know the man 
he was. I know him well. I know that he was a school psychologist, a life he chose so that he 
could help children who could not help themselves. I know he spent countless hours in the 
garden so that he could give my grandmother flowers every morning. I know that he spent 
years with a young boy, the son of a drug addicted mother, taking him to baseball games, 
bringing him home to dinner, and simply teaching him how to live, despite the poor hand 
this boy had been dealt. 
Most importantly, I know that I did not get to know a man that would have made my life 
better in every way. I never got to go to baseball games with him. He never was able to 
cheer for me on the soccer field or basketball court. I know that this great man certainly 
should have been able to live well past 57, yet he was given an abrupt end. An end that he 
deserved less than anyone in the world became his reality. 
This story has made me question what so many people around me believe is an undeniable 
truth. Is God real? 
I was not raised with religion in my life, despite living in a primarily Christian area. When 
my friends went to church on Sunday, I watched the Wiggles. I went to many First 
Communions, cheering on my peers without knowing what I was really celebrating. I have 
listened to countless prayers and promises made to Jesus, while I sat awkwardly alongside. 
Sometimes I would feel jealous that I did not have God to look after me, despite not 
knowing what God was. I never believed or didn’t believe in God, I just never knew. 
The story of my Grandfather’s death is what sparked my curiosity in this matter. I’ve 
always wondered why people believe in God, or what has proven to them the reality of 
God. I’ve asked myself questions like, “Why, if God is all-powerful, would he end a great 
man like my grandfather’s life?” “Why wouldn’t he cause this pain to a murderer or rapist?” 
My questions are still unanswered, and I’m not educated enough at this point to determine 
an answer for myself. Maybe as I grow and learn, I can find an answer."
28,"""If I'll have to be around the old people, I'm not working there. I just don't feel comfortable 
around them. I mean, I can't even understand what they're saying half the time!"" 
Dismissively, I rejected my father's nagging proposal that I apply for a summer job at a local 
long-term care center, arguing that I'd lose my patience much too quickly in attempting to 
interact with elderly residents. However, with my father being, well, my father, I reluctantly filled 
out a job application, reluctantly attended an interview, and, 5 days later, reluctantly commuted 
to an orientation for my position as a 'resident partner'. Although I initially viewed the job as a 
prison sentence which I had been condemned to serve for 8 hours per day, the care center 
would eventually come to serve as a clarion call, challenging each and every preconceived 
notion I held in regards to a globally misunderstood population, and by extension facilitate the 
development of a more socially conscious personal character. 
From the moment I stepped foot in the care center that would soon become a home-away-from-
home for the length of my summer, the entirety of my perspective concerning senior citizens 
was entirely turned upon its head. These elderly persons were nothing near the stereotypical 
portrayals of the generational group which I had taken at face value and had accepted to be 
unalterably true; these individuals appeared to be exactly that: individuals. These individuals 
laughed as if no-one were watching, grinning from ear to ear. These individuals wore 
expressions of abandonment, fighting against tears of sorrow. These individuals engaged in 
enthusiastic conversation with acquaintances, recounting the latest achievement of a 
granddaughter. These individuals engaged in solitary introspection, attempting (albeit 
unsuccessfully) to piece together distant memories of a late wife. Where I had inserted my 
simplistic view of senior citizens as a static monolith, these individuals showcased a mosaic of 
human emotion, destroying the ideological box I had structured around their collective identity. 
Nonetheless, while the past notions which I had nurtured were quickly deprived of their vitality 
as a direct consequence of the myriad behaviors exhibited by the care center's residents, I 
developed a more comprehensive and impactful understanding of the elderly population through 
my interactions with residents suffering from neural afflictions, namely a frail, endearing woman 
named Constance. 
Resultant of the frequency with which Constance and her wheelchair seemed to bump into me, 
it happened that a friendship blossomed between she and I. Revealing to me one afternoon that 
she had endured a stroke decades ago, Constance passively lamented the implications of such 
an experience, among which existed a speech impediment compromising the ease with which 
she could engage in conversation. For some odd reason or another, this confession served as a 
catalyst, utterly decimating any remnant of my elementary view in regards to this social 
demographic. Perhaps owing to the intimate nature of such a statement, or perhaps owing to 
the period of introspection such a statement encouraged within me, Constance's words 
facilitated a realization of the depth of the innumerably varied experiences undergone by senior 
citizens. Not only did Constance demonstrate to me the dynamic, rounded character of elderly 
individuals; Constance unwittingly offered me a glimpse into the unfortunate reality that neural 
diseases are deeply misunderstood, resulting in the reduction of afflicted persons to the 
definition and symptoms of their disease. 
Armed with a newfound awareness of the subtle dehumanization suffered by those found in 
circumstances mirroring Constance's, my interest in the function and coordination of the brain 
and its activity was magnified. Moreover, my tentative decision to pursue a career in 
neurology—in order to reduce the marginalization of elderly individuals by means of amplifying 
general knowledge concerning neurological diseases—was solidified. 
Regardless of whether this aspiration comes to pass, or I head down a different path, it will 
remain true that I left my summer job with so much more than a paycheck."
29,"Seatbelt on. Mirrors adjusted. Key in the ignition. I am ready to roll. I am sitting in the 
parking lot of a DMV with a small Hispanic lady with overly drawn-on eyebrows in the 
passenger seat. In her hands, she holds a beige clipboard and a pen that looks as 
though it has been half-eaten by some underfed pomeranian. Oh wait, it’s not the 
pomeranian, it’s her. She is now gnawing on her pen. Oh gosh, Emily don’t focus on 
that; focus on how you’re going to pull out of this parking lot. I am panting heavily. All of 
the sweat that was once flowing from my body is now on the steering wheel. 
Breath, Emily, breath. I drive to the exit and face a four-lane roadway. “Turn left,” my 
passenger says. 
“Okay,” I mutter back. I can do this. I can totally do this. I am Emily [Name] for goodness 
sake. The Emily [Name] who is president of student council, Failure is not in my 
vocabulary; it never has been, and it never will be. I proceed in driving. “Stop!” Oh no. I 
look to my right to see the examiner grip the ceiling handle with all her might; her eyes 
simulate the expression her penciled-on eyebrows were portraying all along. I am in the 
middle of the roadway; cars are heading towards me in all directions. At that moment, I 
know I failed. 
March 25, [Date], is a day that will live in infamy. The day I experienced 
failure. Unaccepting of my loss, I blamed my driving incompetence on my mother’s 
Chrysler minivan, which had what I liked to call “touchy brakes.” My father was good at 
agreeing with me, adding on with “it’s too foggy out” and “maybe you’re wearing the 
wrong shoes.” Assigning responsibility for my ineptitude to a pair of sneakers was far 
easier than admitting that I just wasn’t good at driving. So, with my ego still at large, I 
decided to take the driver’s test again the following weekend. 
April 1, [Date], is another day that will live in infamy. The day I experienced failure for 
the second time. I failed my road test again, but not for the same reason as before. This 
time I actually made it out of the parking lot. However, I did in fact run over a curb and 
blow a stop sign. I didn’t receive as much sympathy as I did for my earlier attempt. It 
wasn’t the car nor the shoes this time. It was me. I failed my driver’s test all on my own. 
Now, any normal, rational human being would probably call this “not a big deal,” but to 
my high-strung sixteen-year old-self, it was a big deal. How could I have failed 
something that ninety percent of my class mastered on their first try? 
My entire life, I had been accustomed to excelling in whatever I did. Whether it was in 
school work or extracurriculars, my life ran on a simple input-output system. I would put 
the hard work in and out would come immediate success. 
On July 29, [Date], I finally got my license. After the April debacle, I practiced driving 
almost every week. I learned to stop at stop signs and look both ways before crossing 
streets, the things I apparently didn’t know how to do during my first two tests. When 
pulling into the parking lot with the examiner for the last time, a wave of relief washed 
over me. 
“Third time’s the charm,” the lazy-eyed instructor told me. I was ecstatic! For the first 
time in my life, I was licensed in driving as well as licensed in resilience. My experiences 
at the DMV taught me that failure is inevitable and essential to moving forward. As I 
peer down the long road ahead, I am no longer afraid to conquer any bump in my path."
30,"When I first started seriously thinking about college during sophomore year, I didn’t want 
to go anywhere outside of Ohio. I thought I would be too far away from home. But the more 
mail I received from different colleges, the more I realized that some of my best 
opportunities were going to come from outside of my comfort zone, from outside of 
Ohio. One pamphlet from the University of Pennsylvania in particular caught my eye, and 
although I was a bit skeptical at first, as I did my research I realized that the University of 
Pennsylvania is a top tier university that holds many unique opportunities for its students. 
One of the first things I noticed when I began to research Penn was their emphasis on 
interdisciplinary studies. This appealed to me because I have never been interested in only 
one subject. The fact that a third of my classes would be taken outside of the Wharton 
School tells me that I will be able to explore a variety of classes in virtually any subject. For 
example, although I do not want to major in it, I have always been interested in computer 
coding. Hopefully I will able able to take some introductory level computer programming 
or coding classes at Penn even though it is not directly related to finance, my potential 
concentration. I am also excited about the availability of foreign languages at the University 
of Pennsylvania. I started learning French in eighth grade, and since my school only offers 
four years of French, I wasn’t able to take it my senior year, and I really miss it. I also 
started learning Portuguese during high school because I want to travel to Brazil one day. I 
want to continue learning both of these languages at the University of Pennsylvania. I am 
very excited about the opportunities that the emphasis on interdisciplinary studies will 
give me at Penn. 
Another aspect of Penn that I found fascinating was their different programs regarding 
political science. At one point, I wanted to major in political science. But when I took an 
Introduction to Global Politics class at the Ohio State University during the summer before 
my senior year, I didn’t know if I could honestly see myself studying that for four 
years. However, during my time researching political science at Penn, I found out about an 
amazing program that I could participate in: Penn in Washington. Political science is 
currently my second choice major, and if I decide that’s what I want to major in, it would be 
with a concentration in American Politics, so the Penn in Washington program would be 
perfect for me to find an internship and learn about how the different parts of government 
work together in the heart of America’s government. However, if I choose not to major in 
political science, I would still be interested in the American Public Policy minor, which is 
offered through the political science department in the College of Arts and Sciences and the 
Wharton School, which is where I will possibly be pursuing a degree in finance. Penn seems 
to match perfectly with what I want to study in college. I am really excited for the 
opportunities that the University of Pennsylvania will give me. From the interdisciplinary 
studies to the foreign languages and political science programs, I will have plenty of 
chances to explore my diverse interests here at the University of Pennsylvania."
31,"I express my creative side by playing the violin and other musical instruments. Ever 
since I was a younger child, music had always been a part of my life. The first 
instrument I remember playing is the piano when I was four years old. My school had a 
music program, so I went and learned how to read music and play the Recorder. 
Though it was a simple instrument, it was to prepare us students for the more complex 
instruments that we could choose to play after completing the Recorder lessons. 
I took this class all of first grade, and in second grade I was ready to choose the 
instrument I wanted to specialize in. I chose the Violin, and now -ten years later- I am 
still playing it. Throughout the years I have learned to play other instruments as well, 
such as the Piano, Trumpet, Viola, and more. During that time I have also been able to 
play those instruments in different styles of music. 
From second to seventh grade, I played the Violin and sung in my elementary school 
district's Mariachi and my middle school's Mariachi even when I did not know how to 
speak Spanish. I have been playing the Violin at my church's choir almost every Sunday 
since Seventh grade. I played the Violin and Viola in my high school's Orchestra class 
in Freshman and Sophomore year, and since my Junior year I have played the trumpet 
in my school's Jazz Band and Trumpet Choir. 
My siblings have also been inspired to be creative musically, and together we perform 
at our church and other places, and music has become an important part in their lives 
as well. 
Throughout my life I have been able to express my love for music in many different 
ways. Whether through playing with a group, doing a solo in front of an audience, 
composing my own music, or teaching my younger siblings how to read and play music 
the way I was taught many years ago, music has always been a large way that I could 
express my creative side."
32,"Stepping inside the converted railway station, I am transported to another world. Amidst 
gorgeous Beaux-Arts architecture, statues pose on pedestals, and thousands of 
paintings line the adjacent rooms. The Musée d’Orsay is one of the most magical 
museums on Earth. I am immediately drawn to the impressionist exhibits to explore the 
land of Degas and Monet. Dancers stand in rehearsal. Water lilies bask in a pond. The 
sun sets on Notre Dame. The Little Dancer sculpture I have always dreamed of seeing 
stands in its glass case. I am overwhelmed with beauty, moments in time painted into 
immortality and hung up on the wall. Close enough to marvel at the brush strokes taken 
by the artists who painted my favorite famous works of art in existence, I am seeing 
dreams that have come to fruition, paintings that have impacted the world with their 
presence. 
A naturalistic observation at an art museum may not sound like it would be effective, but 
art museums are the best place to observe and learn about a person. My exploration of 
one gives insight into my aptitude for working in the medical field. 
Some people cannot stand art museums. They find no value in looking at pictures on a 
wall for hours and trying to interpret their meaning. These people prefer more concrete 
ideas in life rather than the abstract and do not enjoy the unknown or the unsolved. 
Others go to say that they went. They simply take a picture with the most famous work 
in the museum and call it a day. Some are lucky enough to appreciate the art’s 
meaning, but many of these people are most concerned with their appearance and 
others' opinions on it. Finally, some spend hours absorbing the stories, culture, and 
beauty that hang on the walls. 
I take time interpreting new ideas and perspectives and appreciating the history that lies 
before me. This reflects my open-mindedness, my thirst for knowledge, and simply my 
appreciation for art. I am proud to call myself one of the creatives of the world: an 
imaginative, curious soul. 
If people were to watch me experience the art museum, they would see me pass half of 
the exhibits to get to the ones I am truly enamored by, where I can feel my heart beating 
out of my chest and the gears of my brain going into overload to take in all of the history 
and frozen moments in time that surround me. I carefully examine and stop to ponder at 
the works that truly strike me, and simply take a glance at others. If they were to attempt 
to create a summary of me based on their observations, I am sure they would be 
perplexed. 
I always gravitate towards what matters most to me, the impressionist exhibits of life: 
my passions, the people I love, and discovering new things at every chance I get. I live 
to collect moments, just as the moments in paintings hang on the wall for everyone to 
see for themself. I enjoy when topics are up for interpretation but find comfort in 
knowing the fundamentals and studying what is already known. Above all, I want to help 
others and bring smiles to their faces. I would love to see my impact on the world 
through the happiness of those I touch around me. This is why pursuing medicine is the 
perfect future for me. 
Like solving a puzzle from the inside-out to give patients a fresh canvas, it is a scientific 
art. I want to carry my love for art into my practice of medicine, to find creative ways to 
interpret issues that most would say are unsolvable. My painting, my impact on the 
world, will be creating those blank canvases for others to continue to paint on, working 
to give others their own chance to walk through the art museum we call life."
33,"Though I’m a biochem nerd first and foremost, my interests range widely, as diverse as 
the cells that make up the human body. Just as my passions define who I am, the way I 
see the world and how I hope to better it, each individual within a residential college 
plays a vital role in sustaining the organism that is Baker and Hanszen, Brown and 
McMurtry. From revitalizing old traditions to forging completely new ones, each student 
has a part to play, be it protecting Will Rice’s flag like a white blood cell or organizing 
Baker 90’s party like a neuron. I would be honored to become one of those cells, to 
share my unique interests from emergency medical services (EMS) to baking, to be one 
of many and many in one. 
I’ve spent the last year training to become an EMT, learning how to splint, resuscitate, 
and save lives. My job is to intervene at the most critical points in a person's life, be it 
the suicide attempt of a classmate or the seizures of an elderly man confined to a room 
bereft of light or air-conditioning. Helping and learning from people of all walks of life 
has afforded me a distinctive opportunity; not only have I gained an early exposure to 
medicine, I’ve treated people forgotten by society, realized the significant obstacles 
many have to overcome, seen what is broken and what is left to fix. 
I’d love to continue serving my (new) community at Rice through Rice University 
Emergency Medical Services (REMS), should I be accepted. Not only would I be 
helping the community at large, I’d be close on hand should any of my roommates need 
emergency medical intervention. In addition to helping my immediate community, I 
would work towards improving access to medicine in medically underserved 
communities both in Houston and abroad by joining Humanitarian Medical Outreach 
(HMO), possibly working with my future residential college mates to organize 
fundraising events benefiting the underserved, thereby augmenting Rice’s humanitarian 
impact beyond campus. 
Outside of EMS, I’m an avid outdoorswoman. I’ve hiked for about 12 years now, 
explored the Adirondacks, Denali, and Yosemite. As an active member of my residential 
college, I’d delight in sharing what nature has to offer with my roommates, planning trips 
to local treasures such as Lake Houston Wilderness Park. Not only would such trips 
provide a welcome relief from the intensity of the classroom, they would also foster an 
appreciation for the outdoors and an enthusiasm for conservation. After all, it is much 
more difficult to turn a blind eye to global deforestation and pollution after spending the 
day ensconced in the green-tinged, ever-shifting light of the forest and breathing in fresh 
air. 
I would also love to share my passion for Romanian baking with my roommates by 
cooking in the community kitchens. Making my classmates the desserts of my heritage, 
I’d be sharing just a little bit of me and where I come from in the best way...through 
food!"
34,"It was a crisp fall morning. In the distance, the outlines of trees resembled people. Some 
were tall, slender, brown bodies; some with sparse green-yellow clothes, some naked, 
some with arms spread, some folded, some heads straight, and some hidden. I got out of the 
bed, stepped outside, and to my amazement, discovered these beautiful sticks laying in the 
grass. To most, they are just sticks, but to me, they were pieces of art. 
As I went to pick one of the sticks up, I recognized the brilliance of this simple object that 
had fallen from those beautiful people-like trees. This small yet remarkable brown stick 
that fell from the branches of the tree was part of nature's way to renew life for the coming 
spring. On that brisk fall day, I picked up every stick that fell in the small backyard of my 
house and brought them inside. My mother was annoyed and immediately asked why I was 
bringing garbage into the house. But that didn't stop me. I had an idea, and I knew these 
sticks that she saw as garbage could be turned into something beautiful. 
I took those sticks into my room and placed them on my desk. I then took a small brush to 
gently remove the dirt and some of the bark that had started to decay. They were even 
more beautiful than I had first imagined. The next day, I asked my father to pick up a 3x4 
shadow box frame at the local store and waited in anticipation until he arrived home. When 
I got that frame in my hands, I immediately started working on my computer desk, which I 
turned into a makeshift studio. As I carefully observed, no two sticks were alike, even 
though some fell from the same tree. The vivid image detailing the randomness of nature 
was sitting on my table. As I put sticks together in different patterns, I saw various shapes 
and I quickly recognized that I could use nature to create art. I opened the frame and began 
assembling the sticks in patterns that made sense to me. I closed the back of the frame, 
locked it, and felt my heart pumping to turn it over and see what I created. When I did it 
was beautiful! I had taken something that would typically be discarded and turned it into 
something worthy of being displayed on a wall – I had created art. That first piece of art 
still sits next to my bed, though I have created more shadow-box stick art since then. Some 
have been given as gifts to friends, but more importantly, some have been sold for a loftier 
goal. 
The funds raised from selling these shadow boxes help to support a charity I have 
created. The charity is called Redacted, an umbrella 501(c) organization. Working in 
conjunction with Redacted Charity, a local non-profit, we are providing safe drinking 
water to women and children in developing, and underdeveloped countries. Being a young 
and impressionable woman spending many of my family vacations residing in my 
grandparent’s village, I know first-hand the struggle these women face daily to fetch basic 
clean drinking water for their families. Similar to how I gathered sticks to make art, I plan 
to continue gathering funds and resources to create change in these communities with 
need. Every autumn and beyond."
35,"As the first horse walked in for the HJAM hunter derby in May, I sat on the grassy hill 
overlooking the show grounds with my friends and the “big girls” for the first time. In just 
a few years, I would be one of the “big girls” that the younger kids would look up to. 
Brought together by long horse show days highlighted by donkey races in Kentucky, 
boat days in Traverse City, and “Ride and Drives” in Ohio, the group of riders that 
compete at the horse shows have become my friends for life. 
Starting in the early 2010’s, when all of us rode ponies, everyone began to come out of 
their shell as we bonded over our love for this sport. Jumping the “kid jumps” until it was 
too dark, our group became inseparable, and Sundays, the last day of a horse show, 
became increasingly dreaded as it meant we had to say goodbye until the next show. 
Trading in ponies for horses and bows for hair nets, we became engaged in much more 
mature activities- like water fights and golf cart races. Beginning to conquer bigger 
divisions and national finals, riding became more serious, however, being surrounded 
by this community kept it light hearted as we cheered each other on ringside. 
Entering into my final junior year as a rider, I have trouble believing that I have become 
one of the “big girls” as it seems just yesterday I gazed up at my mentors on the hill 
almost a decade ago. Knowing that the friendships I have made will last a lifetime, I am 
forever grateful to the early mornings and long nights that brought us together and 
cannot wait to watch where each of us end up: both inside and outside of the ring."
36,"When I watched the Patriots and Falcons play in the Super Bowl in February of [Date], I 
had no idea that the next time I watched a football game I would be on the sidelines, 
right in the middle of all the action. However, that’s exactly what happened, and my 
experience as a football manager is not one that I will ever forget. 
At the end of my junior year, the head football coach, Coach Cotter (who was also my 
AP Government teacher), asked me if I wanted to be a manager for the football team. 
He told me I would have to be at all the practices and games during the summer and 
throughout the school year. He made a compelling offer, but I turned him down because 
I didn't think I would have enough time during the summer with my classes, work, and 
vacation. One of my friends, however, took him up on his offer. In the middle of July, 
after hearing her talk about how much she enjoyed it, I asked her if she thought I would 
be able to join. After we spent a little bit talking about it, she asked if I wanted to go with 
her and see what it was like. I agreed, and I loved it. I asked Coach Cotter if he would 
mind if I joined, and I can still hear him saying, ""Absolutely, the more the merrier!"" in my 
head. The weeks of practice that followed, and then eventually the long Friday nights, 
proved to be an unforgettable experience. 
The job of a football manager does not sound glamorous. Being at football practice for 
six hours every day during the summer and then three hours after school, surrounded 
by 47 sweaty football players and seven coaches who are constantly shouting is not 
how I planned to spend my summer and the fall of my senior year. But there was no 
way for me to know that this experience would teach me valuable lessons about life, 
regarding teamwork, hard work, and discipline. 
In late July it was evident that some of the players were new and unsure of what to do. I 
watched as day after day the upperclassmen helped them learn their positions and 
become better players. This demonstration of teamwork impressed me, because 
instead of laughing at the younger players for not knowing what to do, they helped them 
become the best players they could be to make the team stronger. Once, three of our 
seniors got in trouble for some off field activities, and they had to sit out the first game, 
along with losing their helmet stickers that are given out for exceptional performances. I 
witnessed the effect that the consequences had on these players, and I heard one of 
our coaches after we lost the game tell them “Now you see how the consequences of 
your actions affected the entire team. Don't ever underestimate your importance to this 
team.” After that game, I saw the hard work that those boys put in to earn back their 
reputations and their helmet stickers. They taught me that even if I make mistakes, I will 
always learn from them no matter how much hard work it takes. 
We managers go by many names: watergirls, team managers, hydration specialists. But 
none of these monikers can capture the rush of emotion I feel after a hard fought game, 
or the feeling of connectedness that comes every time we celebrate as a team after a 
victory, ringing our bell and blasting “Party in the USA.” My sense of school spirit has 
never been stronger. Throughout the summer, the three hours after school, and the 
seven hours I spend on game days with the players, I have learned lessons and 
developed relationships that I will never forget."
37,"“One of the parents emailed me, saying their daughter came home terrified because of 
your lunch-time horror stories.” 
I was in third grade, and Mrs. Brewer pulled me aside at lunch. She leaned down - 
barely, however, as she was already so short - and gently grabbed my shoulder. Her 
lips were chapped and pink and wisps of her soft gray hair outlined her round face. 
Without a mirror, I already knew my cheeks were red. The idea of getting in 
trouble engulfed my face with heat and tingled the tip of my nose. “It’s okay!” she 
assured me, with an air that suggested she found the whole situation amusing. “I just 
wanted to tell you so you could stop. You aren’t in trouble.” I granted a small nod, my 
mouth drier than the Sahara. She stood and patted my back. “Alright.” 
That was the first time a story I created had ever affected anyone else; part of me 
danced in the sunlight, while a larger part of me ruminated in the dark, worried about the 
trouble I may have caused because someone’s daughter came home terrified thanks to 
some chubby, nerdy girl’s ghost stories. However, for that chubby, nerdy girl, those 
scary campfire stories were her door into the A-list social crowd of the lunchroom; the 
popular girls in my grade invited me to their table every day. Granted, I knew they only 
wanted me for entertainment. But, man, it felt good to be wanted, and it still does. 
When my films affect other people, I feel joy. For example, “Cardboard Castles” is a 
drama I co-directed about a father with a terminal illness grappling with the challenges 
of explaining to his daughter that he is dying. When I watch it with an audience and the 
audience begins to cry, it means I have successfully conveyed a story that connected 
deeply with others. There’s not a feeling in the world like it. 
From creating make-believe scenarios with dollhouses to Scooby-Doo movies made by 
my cousins and me to producing my own films, stories follow me like cats follow laser 
pointers. I feed off of other people’s energy like a new-age carnivore. I am fascinated by 
the human experience and enjoy thinking, talking, learning, and even complaining about 
it. With this in mind, it makes sense that I talked to random strangers as a toddler, loved 
history class, and have participated in student council since I attended a school that 
offered it. 
To build on this, storytelling is one of the most human things we do. As far as we know, 
humans are the only species who do this. From cave walls to the Globe Theatre to 
online fanfiction, humans have been telling stories since we could think. Now, I find 
myself considering a career path, and I have concluded with certainty that I want–
no, need–to collaborate with others to celebrate the human experience. 
So, here I am, pushing forward with my motivation to become a successful director. I 
want to influence filmmaking in a revolutionary way. I want to be an auteur. I want little 
girls to look up to me and see that directing is something they can do. I want to win 
awards. I want to mentor young filmmakers and help them overcome obstacles. I want 
to push limits and break glass ceilings. I want to tell stories the world needs to hear. I 
am so fortunate to have found a profession that combines all of my skills and passions 
into one expansive field. My leadership, resilience, creativity, and drive are like a 
delicious soup served at one specific restaurant: the film industry."
38,"Since seventh grade, I’ve been obsessed with making others smile. That year was tough on 
my 12-year-old, bewildered self. It was the first time I’d struggled through anything major 
in my life. Someone important in my life passed away. Several relationships were beaten up 
and broken down. My once-straight-A grades took a turn for the worse as the magnet 
school experience bore down upon me. And ever since I was forced to be that one kid who 
cried through lunch with her head down on the table, I decided to make sure nobody else 
would have to be that kid. 
I’ve tried everything to hear someone’s laugh, from biting sarcasm to the pain of a bad pun. 
But when I think about when my friends and I are laughing the most, it’s all together, in a 
call at midnight. We’re playing computer games and listening to silly music and laughing at 
the expense of each other as we die at the hands of the enemy team in the most ridiculous 
ways. 
I started playing League of Legends late last year. It was a way for me to feel strong and 
unstoppable when I felt powerless in reality. The gameplay was what initially hooked me, 
but everything else about the game was equally, if not more, fascinating. The design of the 
maps, champions, and skins. The precise animations and detail in every interaction. The 
engrossing theme songs and background music, especially ones like Aurelion Sol’s 
intro (highly recommend, by the way; it’s a beautifully written, insistent orchestral piece). 
The concept of worldbuilding and forever expanding upon the backstories of over a 
hundred characters and their universe. The way gaming brings all sorts of people together 
and lets them really laugh. 
I once read a throwback article, called “Total Recall, or: That Time We Disabled Ranked,” 
that was written by product managers, designers, and producers. It covered an intensive 
bug that forced the company to work nearly 28 hours straight in order to restore the game 
and discussed the processes behind bugfixing. It was this article that truly incensed my 
interest in game design. 
When reading about the majors and programs that Cornell provides, I felt a rare yet very 
real spark of excitement for college and my future. I’d heard of the notoriety of the 
Computer Science major at Cornell, but the option to follow the major within the School of 
Arts and Sciences eased my mind. As a right-brained student, I’ve always felt the struggle to 
succeed academically, especially within maths and sciences, while still pursuing my artistic 
interests. The BA CS major gives the ability to major in what I want to do while also getting 
exposure to a larger breadth of courses in other schools. I believe that Cornell will be able 
to reconcile my passions and style of learning by providing an environment in which I can 
thrive. 
But what caught my eye the most was the specific game design minor that I could pursue 
alongside a major in computer science. It seems pretty unique to the school and is exactly 
what I’ve been wanting from a prospective school. Through this route, I’d be able to further 
my current understanding of programming and learn how to apply this to the world of 
design and animation. I’d be worlds closer to not only bringing my ideas to life, but also 
bringing the same happiness, excitement, and immersion that I feel to other gamers like 
me. 
Gaming is what brings a smile to my face, as it does to millions of other people around the 
globe. I want my efforts to inspire happiness and infectious laughter to reach the world by 
doing what I love. And now, it truly feels as though Cornell has given me a real chance at 
being able to make someone smile by doing what they love."
39,"“If you care about your future, you shouldn’t allow yourself to think such things.” 
My mom used to tell me this a lot. She’d always disapproved of my passion for the arts. 
My dreams are a few sizes too big for me and my parents make sure I’m well aware of 
it. In an ideal world, I’d have a knack for composing and singing sappy ballads and I’d 
be well on my way towards making it big in Korea’s music industry. 
However, my parents are firmly against my making music for a living. They’d rather 
have me study a more academically inclined subject, like law or business. I can’t blame 
them, either -- socially, any career in the arts is looked down upon. It’s true that fine arts 
careers are not as financially supportive as careers in scientific or mathematical areas 
of study. Music and arts are usually for consumer enjoyment, while science and math 
have real world “purpose”. However, without fine arts, our worlds would be empty and 
monochrome. They hold so much importance in our lives, yet people disregard them 
and forget that there are people behind these masterpieces of lyrical art, writing songs 
for a living. 
During my more frivolous years, I used to dream of becoming a singer-songwriter. Every 
time I brought it up with my parents, they’d laugh in my face and ask if I was 
joking. They’d say that if I truly cared about my future, I shouldn’t allow myself to have 
such dreams. It’s hard to become successful, they’d say, and compare me to all the 
people that have tried and failed. It was a little discouraging, to say the least. I hit the 
looming wall of my dilemma just last year -- how could I reconcile my passions with my 
parents’ wishes? Was there even a solution out there? 
Eventually, I came to understand their viewpoint. It’s hard to deny the fact that careers 
in STEM are more profitable and sustainable. I still retain my love of music and desire to 
continue working on my ability, but now I’ve found another outlet of creativity: 
programming. The way so many components interact and come together to become 
something as equally as beautiful as song lyrics, albeit in its own way -- a polished 
mechanism, an aesthetic webpage, an organized and concise block of code. I used to 
be so reluctant to test the coding waters, content to reside on familiar shores, but it 
wasn’t difficult to experience the incredible joy of working through and solving problems. 
As soon as I stepped into the world of computers, it felt as though a hundred doors had 
just opened in front of me. I could peek through the doorway of entrepreneurialism or 
the entryway of graphic design. I could easily get involved with AI and its moral 
questions, or create my own universe and every character. I could even stir in my 
passion for music by working with electronic music. And I think I’ve solved my dilemma. 
I discovered the concept of game design as an industry during the summer before 
senior year, when I had the pleasure of speaking to Sheri Graner Ray, a game design 
veteran. She told me about all of the different divisions -- the programming, the writing, 
and the audio -- and her own company, Zombie Cat Studios. She told me about her 
work in gender inclusivity within the industry. And once I kept searching for more, it felt 
as though the world of game design had been created for me. For the first time outside 
of music, I felt an incredible excitement to chase after a new dream. Being able to 
appease my parents was an added plus. 
In the end, I don’t count on getting my parents’ approval of my passions any time soon. I 
hope to be able to prove myself to them eventually."
40,"I was still high off the competition, poring over ballots by the soft streetlights as we 
drove. “Are you sure you want to do this?” My Dad was worried about me. Worried 
about my world crashing down around me, losing friends, being crushed by hate. 
Scarred by controversy. I laughed it off, and we rode in silence. 
Forgive the melodrama: this is a story about being a dissident in an authoritarian 
regime, but it’s a fun story. From 12 years old, I grew up in the NCFCA—the National 
Christian Forensics and Communication Association, a homeschool speech and debate 
league. My friends and I joked that the only difference between fascist Italy and the 
NCFCA is that in Italy, things at least ran on time. But this is how my political awakening 
began: a summer debate camp in [Date] that my parents sent me to because I “always 
argued.” I was hooked. 
Politically, the NCFCA is conservative. Not totally homogenous, but Christian and 
homeschooled. At the same time I was learning debate—how to think—in that 
context, my Dad and I started watching The Daily Show with Jon Stewart and talking 
about its subjects. This duality was key: as I developed my own, left-leaning views, I 
was surrounded by very smart people who disagreed with me. I had instant access 
to the best arguments against my beliefs—instant access to the best tools to refine 
them. Beyond that, though, it imparted empathy: seeing a wide range of views held by 
people that I liked and respected (and still do) made me want to understand. I loved it. 
Fast forward to my second or third year in the league. I wanted to have some fun. I 
emailed the regional coordinator, asking if there’s a rule against a speech advocating for 
same-sex marriage. 
The answer? “No, but people wouldn’t like it.” That was fine. That was the point. 
Why do a persuasive speech if everyone already agrees with you? The first draft of the 
speech was straightforward: establish the separation of church and state, then outline 
the secular arguments for gay marriage. Watching everything from disgust to 
bemusement play across my club members’ faces as I gave the speech, hearing the 
note of concern that didn’t quite mask the edge creeping into the critique, I tried again. I 
built a theological argument, established common ground with my audience, and I was 
going to persuade them. I never got the chance. A couple months before competition 
season began, we were pulled aside at club. The hushed tones, the guarded 
expressions—the room was heavy with quiet, administrative displeasure. It wasn’t a 
two-sided conversation. They told me two things: I couldn’t give the speech in 
club (because controversy has no place in a debate club!), and the national leadership 
decided my speech didn’t reflect a Biblical worldview. Meaning? Banned speech. 
After writing a flurry of ultimately ineffective emails, I did a speech on why we should 
embrace theological diversity. That speech wasn’t fueled by spite—though I do enjoy 
the irony of its birth, and I sarcastically named the word document “HERESY.” Rather, I 
wanted to make a point. Christian Abolitionism, the Nicene Creed, the doctrine of the 
Trinity: all once hotly debated products of dissent, iron sharpening iron. Of 
history’s 40,000+ competing theologies, why assume that you’ve come along and finally 
gotten the Bible right? I didn’t do well with this speech, but I still won: because I am 
unbroken—not scarred, but emboldened. I saw intolerance, but I also see hope. To this 
day, some of my closest friendships are built upon discussions of theology and 
politics, iron on iron, punctuated by laughter. Hope lives in that laughter, because as it 
dances between us, it brings with it empathy and wisdom."
41,"At the start of high school, I saw nothing but success. From grades to extracurricular 
activities, everything seemed to be going smoothly. However, as my sophomore year 
progressed, this wave of success was soon swamped by a wave of disillusionment. I 
struggled to perform in Calculus and as a Vice-President, but instead of looking for a 
solution, I looked for excuses. Ultimately, when I was forced to face my two F’s and my 
lost elections, the world came crashing down. The vision I had meticulously planned out 
for the future seemed to shatter before my eyes. My self-confidence plummeted to an 
all-time low. I thought my life was over. 
However, my response to this failure was what would ultimately determine the direction 
my life would take. In the end, I made the right choice: instead of continuing to blind 
myself with a false narrative that cast all the blame off my own shoulders, I admitted to 
my own shortcomings and used this experience as a lesson to grow from. 
In doing so, I learned to focus on the aspects of my life that I was truly passionate about 
instead of spreading myself too thin. I learned to face challenges head-on instead 
cowering at the first sign of difficulty, even if it meant asking others for help. I learned to 
accept and utilize my own differences to create my own unique leadership style. Most 
importantly, rather than letting this mistake define me, I ignited a sense of determination 
that would guide me back on the right path no matter how many obstacles I encounter. 
Looking back, this tragic mistake was a double-edged sword. While it definitely leaves a 
stain on my record, it is also likely that I wouldn’t have been able to find the same 
success a year later without the lessons I gained from this experience. At the end of the 
day, while I still grimace every time I contemplate my sophomore year, I understand 
now that this mistake is what has allowed me to develop into the person I am today."
42,"A few weeks before freshman year of high school, I stood and stared wide eyed in front 
of the fortress that is Lincoln. I was there on a mission. Today, I would choose the 
language I’d take for the next four years. 
The list of languages that Lincoln offered startled me. “There’s so many,” I thought, 
“Latin, Spanish, Chinese, and French.” 
About an hour prior, my mom told me, “You need to take Spanish! You could do so 
much with it.” A couple days before that, multitudes of people advised me that I would 
regret taking anything other than Spanish. 
There’s nothing wrong with Spanish, but I didn’t have a hunger for it. It didn’t seem 
appetizing. At first glance, I knew what I wanted. I wanted Chinese, and it was mine the 
moment I laid eyes on it. 
I excelled in Chinese class. I passed every test with flying colors. I remembered 
Chinese characters like they were the names of my best friends. I could converse. 
Chinese attached itself to every part of my life. I translated anything I could get my 
hands on, like magazines and menus. It even infiltrated my dreams. I dreamt of radicals 
and the past life of every character. The only thing I had to do now was visit China. 
China was like a far off wish, though. Until it wasn’t. A trip to China was in our school’s 
future. My mom couldn’t pay for a trip, though. She can’t work because of her 
disabilities, and I have three other siblings as well as a nephew all in one house. But I 
didn’t let that dissuade me, because China was a once in a lifetime opportunity, and I 
wasn’t going to let slip away. I started a GoFundMe page, did other fundraisers, and 
asked for personal donations until I finally reached the whopping total of $5,500. That 
money covered a passport, visa, plane ticket, and a 9-day guided educational tour as 
well as extra spending money. 
As soon as I stepped off the plane, and set my eyes upon the beautiful city of Shanghai, 
I fell in love. In that moment, I had an epiphany. China was made for me, and I wanted 
to give it all my first; first job and first apartment. 
Everywhere I looked there were people who spoke the language I loved, Mandarin, so I 
did what any rational person would do. I made conversation. I talked to moms, kids, 
seniors, middle schoolers, high schoolers, store clerks, food vendors, and grocery 
attendants. The list could go on. 
Being able to talk with people who had a completely different background than I did 
astounded me. Some of us had nothing in common but this wonderful language. I 
shared stories and personal views with so many people I didn’t know, and in return I got 
innumerable ones from them. The Chinese gave me a piece of their culture and 
accepted me with open arms. There were so many things in the world that I had never 
experienced, but these people had. Their stories would be the ones I’d share with my 
children and grandchildren. 
This trip helped me realized how I’m just one person--one small speck--in this 
world. There is so much more to learn and experience. My trip to China is the reason I 
want to teach English abroad. The connections I made were because I was able to 
communicate. Having a second or third language at your disposal makes you an asset. 
Whole new cultures are open to you. I want kids and adults to be able to make lifelong 
connections just as I did when I was in China. 
“Junzi zhi xin bù sheng qí xiao, ér qìliàng hángài yish.” (Géyán lián bì) is a 
Chinese proverb that reminds us that we should not act for our own selfish desires, but 
rather try to serve the greater good."
43,"I close my eyes and find myself within a forest of lights. 
The diamond leaves of gnarled oak trees throw spectrums of color onto mounds of frosty snow that gleam 
melancholily under the moonlight. The leaves chime as wind violently rustles them in a haunting melody. I 
splinter a leaf off its branch and inspect the shard of my illusion, eyes dancing with amusement. 
I breathe a cloud into the nipping air and halfconsciously crunch through a path of snow as it languorously 
carves its way through the forest. I walk to the sound of clinking, broken gems as they scratch my ankles, 
and wonder what circuitry must be alight in my wits to create this particular fantasy. I stumble along in 
hope of unravelling this enigma, my mind guiding me on its own inclination. 
The path opens up at last, and I approach a cabin shrouded by thick fog. The door opens for me and I 
wonder at the foreboding as I sit in a cherrywood chair and sip a sparkling chartreuse drink. My feet swing 
idly as I listen to the forest’s indiscernible whispers, wondering whether my mind would ever allow me to 
unstitch its knots. 
As I dwell in my worries, a cold hand reaches from behind me and taps my shoulder. 
I jerk away, fear bubbling in my amygdala as I look into the nonexistent eyes of my intruding visitor. 
The moon illuminates a blob of pink squish as it draws back slowly, points its spindly hands towards my 
drink and asks: “Could I have some of that?” 
I wordlessly offer the eerie thing some Mountain Dew. I watch as it eagerly chugs the drink, and think, 
Ah. My mind is definitely acting strangely today. 
The blob wipes its invisible mouth with its nonexistent sleeve. I ask: “What are you?” 
It shakes its head, invigorated with soda. “S’pose it’s natural not to recognize me.” The thing smiles 
ominously and declares itself as my brain. 
I stare mutely at the absurd being. I wonder at how I will be able to paint it in my waking state. 
The blob tells me to stop looking at it so suspiciously. “I can prove it,” It says. I tell it, please, go ahead. 
Suddenly we are back in the glowing forest. “Diamonds? Pah!” The blob dismisses them. Instantly, the 
leaves turn solid gold, the snow melts, and the wintry world is thrown into a blistering summer. 
The blob laughs heartlessly. “Your cortex is under my control,” it says smugly. 
I blink under the sudden intensity and acknowledge its greatness, humbled by its supremacy. 
“I heard you had a question for me?” It taps its invisible ears knowingly. 
This is perfect, I think. Here I was all this time wandering through my mind, searching for the answer, 
when now I could ask my brain for it directly. 
The blob wriggles its invisible brows as it waits. 
I open my mouth and ask it my most crucial question. 
It smiles that wicked smile. It laughs that sinful laugh. Then that insufferable blob wakes me up. 
As I sit up in the dark and rub my bleary eyes, I am vaguely aware of the deepset unfulfillment settling 
itself inside me. I yawn and plop back into bed, the soft red glow of my alarm clock indicating that it is still 
before midnight. 
I cover myself with blanket, and drift back into sleep to continue my search."
44,"Throughout my college search, I had yet to come across the perfect undergraduate school 
for my interests. The safe pick was always the standard “College of Arts and Sciences” or its 
equivalent, with the most varied options for me to craft my experience. Something was 
different about Michigan. I didn’t need to craft my own academic experience at another 
university when the perfect one was already designed here: The School of Kinesiology’s 
Movement Science program. 
In my house, we never eat scrambled eggs. We eat denatured albumin and yolk proteins 
served with a sprinkling of sodium chloride; cooking was chemistry, not just a chore. From 
a young age, my parents have cultivated a sense of curiosity in me. So when I injured my 
left wrist in the summer before freshman year, it was so much more than just an injury. I 
researched more into my growth plate dislocation and radial fracture. I got to see the 
details of the procedure, the recovery process, and the gradual reversion of my X-rays to a 
normal wrist image. This fascinating journey got me through an otherwise disappointing 
summer: no basketball and no french horn. 
While the seeds were planted during my injury, they didn’t start blooming until I spent a 
week shadowing Dr. Kesavan Ramanujan in the Royal United Hospital, Bath, England. I 
realized that the field of orthopedics was a field where I could visually identify a problem, 
come up with a solution, implement the solution through operation, and help someone 
progress to full recovery. The gratification on the doctor’s faces when their recovered 
patients came back to visit them was infectious. While this trip was my first time staying 
abroad without my family, the biggest takeaway for me was that I had found a career I was 
truly interested in. 
My volunteer work at the Robert Wood Johnson Hospital Physiotherapy Clinic has only 
strengthened this notion. While my work as a volunteer may be the more routine tasks: 
making schedules, doing paperwork, cleaning the beds and the gym, setting up hot packs, 
cold packs, and stimulation pads, I have learned so much about the subtle details of patient 
interaction through what I absorb from the physical therapists. Even if a PT is having a bad 
day, they have taught me how important it is to have a smile on your face for the next 
patient coming through the doors. They have also taught me how much of an intersection 
there is between teaching and medicine/therapy. 
These experiences draw me to the School of Kinesiology, and specifically the Movement 
Science program. The opportunity to actively engage with skeletomuscular system studies 
as opposed to solely classroom learning appeals to me, as do the extensive research 
opportunities. The specialized IONM Intraoperative Neuromonitoring Program-- the only 
accredited IONM program in the world-- would give me the chance to engage in an exciting, 
interdisciplinary curriculum that cannot be found anywhere else. 
From scrambled eggs to broken bones; from British adventures to lessons learned in the 
RWJ clinic. Discovering my passion for orthopedics and movement science has already 
been an exhilarating ride; yet, these have all been just the beginning steps of my journey. I 
cannot think of a better place to continue than the University of Michigan."
45,"I am a person of the woods, and every summer when I come back from my canoe 
tripping camp, I have transformed from the city dweller that defines ten months of my 
year to the wilderness man my friends jokingly call me. Canoe tripping is so much more 
than carrying a canoe or a pack, or paddling lakes bigger than my whole city; it’s about 
the people you’re with, the friendships you create, learning about yourself, and your 
relationship with your surroundings. 
I have spent every summer since I was seven at Camp Pathfinder, building friendships 
with people who were so different than me each year. Pathfinder has a way of bringing 
people together from different backgrounds, sides of the continent, even countries, and 
bonding them for life. I have friends all the way across my continent in Los Angeles, 
friends who I’d never seen before who actually live on my street, and even friends who 
live in Spain. Going across the trails with packs half our size and more than half our 
weight, or canoes sixteen feet, you get to know each other well and deeply. My friends 
range from seven years old to sixty-three. At Pathfinder, everyone is equal 
and everyone is in the same boat, or canoe for that matter. 
When I first went to camp, I loved being on the island, but hated canoe tripping. Being 
forced to carry a pack and traveling by canoe was awful. Where was the fun in sleeping 
in small tents with an absurd amount of mosquitoes and aching after portaging? I came 
home crying that first summer, but for some odd reason, I was drawn back. It took four 
years until, finally, I understood. I went on a twelve day canoe trip and it clicked; I had 
the time of my life, and I was hooked. Since then, I’ve come to appreciate not only 
learning about the people I am with, but the environment that surrounds me. The 
sunsets in Algonquin Park are the most beautiful on Earth, seeing water at the end of an 
arduous portage feels greater than spying land from the lake, the sound of a loon has 
an unmatched purity, and the fog on the water draws you to it. 
My friend Aidan has taught me to push myself harder than I thought possible; Tate 
taught me there is no rest until we have made the trip as good as it can be for the 
younger campers; Gabe showed me that laughter is the best way out of any situation. 
From Rohan I’ve learned there is always a solution, and from Grady I’ve learned that it 
IS possible to encompass all of the ideals that define each of us. From me, they say 
they have learned leadership, and I hope that is true. 
Anywhere I go, I can meet someone with some strange connection to Pathfinder and 
this common ground alone allows us to talk on a more intimate level, passing the “get-
to-know-you” stage of acquaintances. We bond over past staff, mutual friends, canoe 
trips, lakes in the park, and our beautiful, red, cedar-strip, canvas canoes. Pathfinder 
has jokingly been referred to as a cult because of the way we religiously worship our 
“sacred” island. The scary part is, this is true. We worship the canoes that allow us to 
travel and we thank the great spirit, who constantly watches over us. 
In reality, it is more similar to one large family with thousands who share the one 
hundred five years of its history. Our days of canoe tripping and pushing each other 
connects us deeply. When we sit around the fires at the end of the day, we don’t need 
to talk; we just need to relax and enjoy one another’s company. And as we lay down our 
heads, on our soft balsam beds, we thank the great spirit that our blood runs Pathfinder 
red."
46,"As I sat alone in a crowded airport, I felt both excitement and nervousness. I took my 
laptop and opened it to the Facebook profile of my third cousin Joey. I remembered how 
curious I was the first time I learned about his existence. He seemed just like me. I 
could not have been more excited, for I was on my way to New Jersey to spend spring 
break at his parents’ house. 
It may seem strange that I was so eager to meet a third cousin, as most Americans 
have minimal contact with relatives as distant as third cousins. Meeting distant relatives 
meant expanding the family tree, forming new connections, and expanding support 
networks. Setting down new roots by travelling to New Jersey to meet Joey not only felt 
right but also necessary. 
After landing and meeting Joey and his mom Alla, I felt awkward; we had absolutely 
nothing to discuss. Maybe visiting people I have never met was a mistake. 
That night Alla explained to me that partner dominos was a family tradition dating back 
50 years in the Soviet Union. I had never played dominos with a partner. Absolutely 
stunned, Alla cried, “YOU HAVE NEVER PLAYED PARTNER DOMINOS? HOW THE 
HELL IS YOUR MOTHER RAISING YOU?” The rest of the night we played partner 
dominos, and let me admit, I was awful. Nevertheless, I experienced a strong sense of 
belonging and connection to my heritage by taking part in an old family tradition. That 
game broke the ice and made me realize that we share a cultural and personal 
connection; starting with that game, I actually felt like we were family members. Unsure 
of what else my mom had neglected, Alla inundated me with an entire rundown of my 
extended family. I learned that I could travel to almost every continent, knowing there 
would always be someone to whom I am related. Due to my family’s Russian heritage, I 
would always be welcome, adept at partner dominos or not. 
A week later when I sat waiting for my flight home, I smiled. People whom I had just 
met, who had their own busy lives to live, took me in and made me feel welcome. At the 
end of the visit, I felt as if I had known Joey and Alla my entire life. I had to acknowledge 
that I had underestimated the need for extended family in my life. Furthermore, as I 
contemplated the transition from stranger to family member, my mind took me further to 
comprehend that whether related or not, I would live a more fulfilling life if willing to 
make vital connections. I consider every person with whom I forge a connection part of 
my “family” network, regardless of how remote. Though I had thought of “family” as 
merely a support system, I realized now that it is comprised of the people who, through 
powerful shared experiences, help one find a place in the world. 
When I launch into the next phase of my life, I am hoping to forge relationships with 
roommates, classmates, and professors. As a global citizen, I am also dedicated to 
connect with others and help them find a place in this world, just like Alla and Joey did 
for me."
47,"""A plate of spaghetti, six pieces of chicken nuggets, a bowl of fish soup, and a plate of 
French fries covered in chili sauce. And, don't forget the dessert, make it warm 
chocolate with milk. Oh... I could also use that 500ml lemonade as you process the 
order please."" 
The disbelief printed in the face of the waiter as he scribbled my order confirmed to me 
that he definitely heard me right. I get that look a lot and I kind of got used to it. In fact 
most of my friends have teased that my extremely huge appetite is a genetic disorder. 
Well if you ask me, I think they just envy me. 
I come from a family that most people would refer to as humble although I think we eat 
as ""Royalty"". Ma spends her day either preparing for the next meal or cleaning up after 
the previous one. Meals are the only time, if you were lucky enough, you could slip in a 
request to Papa and at least get a promise. Further, when anyone got sick, they would 
first be served with twice their average consumption as the first medication; if symptoms 
persisted then you could see a physician. The ""chiemo"", Ma's name for our meals, was 
guided by one rule, ""Your plate had to be cleared regardless of how much food you 
were served."" Probably that and Ma's belief that food consumption was directly 
proportional to physical and intellectual growth, are responsible for my eating 
tendencies. 
As I grew older and started going to school, I picked up a habit that anytime something 
made me uncomfortable, whether it was a sum or Sam the bully, I would seclude myself 
and devour whatever Ma had packed in my lunch box. Surprisingly once I was satisfied, 
my mind was composed and I could think straight or face my fears. I rode under this 
without noticing any oddity till I got to high school. 
School was thousands of miles from home. All my conscious childhood memories were 
made inside our camp bubble and I hadn't as much as stepped out the camp let alone 
travelled that far. Papa and Ma hadn't gone to high school and had no advice 
whatsoever to help me cope. I remember Ma looking into my teary eyes promising to 
bring me as much food as she could the next time she was allowed into the school. 
The subsequent weeks were rough as I not only kept unsuccessfully asking for extra 
portions but also had to bear the perplexed stares from fellow students. When I 
eventually adapted to the rations, I had a change of perspective. I got a deeper 
understanding of addictions as mind illusions that we are totally dependent on some 
amounts of different substances which couldn't be further than the truth. That prompted 
me to join my school's guidance and counselling team where I shared my story to 
counsel fellow students who were reported to be drug addicts. 
Since then through my appetite for different taste of food I have learnt to identify and 
appreciate different cultures in my country. For instance when served beef I 
could identify the economic activity, geographic location, and even guess the mood of 
the cook by looking at the sizes, the amount of soup in the stew, and how precisely the 
spices have been added respectively. This has led me to appreciate our different 
cultures in defining who we are and celebrating our diversity. 
However, control over my appetite doesn't mean it got any smaller. When I miss home, I 
eat. When I code, I eat. When I am worried, I eat. When people get worried that I eat 
too much, I eat. The only difference is I have a choice, but mostly I still chose to eat."
48,"My drooping eyes fluttered, biding time before my inevitable descent into a well-
deserved slumber. My hand scratched on with determination as I reflected on the past 
VEX robotics season in my engineering notebook. As I penned my final entry, the once 
heavy strokes of ink regressed into nothingness, and the cartridge breathed its last, one 
final victim of my notebook. With an internal salute, I disposed of the pen and retrieved 
another to finish my reflection. When finally content with my writings, I clicked my pen 
shut and let out a deep sigh of closure before sauntering up to my bed. As I lay down, I 
realized that my dedication to my engineering notebook had concluded a crucial leg in 
my journey toward further education and adulthood. My mind wandered back to the 
beginning. 
Going into my freshman year, my high school's VEX Robotics program personified the 
proverbial David facing other organizations’ Goliaths. With only one adviser, our poorly 
funded team struggled to compete with the private clubs who could access high-tech 
engineering rooms stocked abundantly with building materials. Despite the program’s 
frugality, my team successfully qualified for the Wisconsin State Championship in my 
freshman and, then, sophomore year. During those years we earned respect throughout 
the VEX community, but we never procured any awards that would solidify our 
program’s competitiveness. To win awards, teams must document their robotics 
progress in an engineering notebook. During my junior year, with the desire to improve 
my VEX club’s prestige, I volunteered to create the notebook. At the time, I feared the 
commitment, never anticipating the unforeseen rewards. 
As I progressed through my junior year, I crafted the engineering notebook assiduously; 
I set timetables, documented brainstorming sessions, and sketched potential designs all 
in hopes of winning an award to validate my team. With the first competition 
approaching, my team spent countless hours building and coding the robot, constantly 
overcoming the challenges presented by our lack of building materials. In spare 
moments between schoolwork and VEX, I worked feverishly on the notebook. When 
competition day arrived, I worried that all our hard work would be unavailing. Despite my 
apprehensions, we performed exceptionally, and we went on to win the tournament. 
Furthermore, my team won the Design Award, which recognizes the best engineering 
notebook. I felt momentarily overjoyed, but I realized that perseverance could potentially 
multiply our success. Upon arriving home, I withdrew to my room and continued my 
meticulous work in my engineering notebook. By the time the State Championship 
arrived, teams from around Wisconsin respected our program. We were no longer 
underdogs; rather, we were fierce competitors. At State, we won the CREATE Award for 
a well-documented and creative design solution, and we qualified for the CREATE US 
Open Championship. Representing Wisconsin at the national level was the greatest 
honor of my life. Reshuffling my pillow, my reverie ceased as I considered how my 
experience creating the engineering notebook taught me invaluable life lessons of 
tenacity and diligence. I thought about how I no longer bore a childish fear of 
commitments; instead, I embraced new challenges. Moreover, I realized the notebook 
enhanced my time management skills both in the short-term and in the long-term. I 
often worked ahead on homework to leave time for writing, and I learned to make 
decisions about the overall timeline of our project. 
Above all, however, the notebook helped me realize that I should study business 
instead of following the typical VEX participant’s engineering path. I found my niche 
when I focused on project management with the notebook instead of concentrating on 
the specifics of the robot. In a final wink of consciousness, I felt true happiness knowing 
that my hard work had paid off. Then I closed my eyes and drifted off to sleep."
49,"""Runners take your marks, get set, collaborate?"" 
When one attempts to characterize the sport of cross-country, the term 'teammates' 
rarely comes to mind. More commonly, the activity is associated with words such as 
'champion' or 'competitor', both singular nouns. Therefore, it is not difficult to imagine 
the extent of my surprise when, stepping into my first-ever cross-country practice as a 
lanky ninth-grader, I witnessed the sense of camaraderie present among the more 
established members of the team. Despite my acknowledgement of these runners as 
teammates, I held my opposing views of cross-country and of collaboration at the poles 
of my mind, convinced that the two were terminally incompatible. Stubbornly clinging to 
this black-and-white philosophy, I carried it with me throughout the season's inaugural 
meet, unaware of the burden that such a dichotomous perspective created. Instead of 
tuning into the motivated cheering of coaches, I tuned into the laborious pumping of my 
arms, resultant of the intensity of the race. 
Opposed to focusing on the changes in pace effected by my teammates, I chose to 
focus on the chafing around my ankles, resultant of an ill-fitting pair of racing spikes. 
Intent of ensuring my own success, I willfully ignored the reality that, although my 
teammates were assuming the role of rivals, my teammates were simultaneously 
assuming the role of collaborators, purposefully striving to ensure the success of one 
another. Consequently, the competing teams engaging in cooperative conduct similarly 
happened to be the teams with the greatest overall achievement at that first meet. 
While witnessing the success of collaborative teams certainly set into motion a 
transformation of my polarized perspective in regards to cross-country, the true catalytic 
factor materialized itself as the interactions carried out between my teammates and I. 
As the season progressed, and as I gradually gained awareness of the team's nuanced 
character, I noticed that the strengths of one teammate served to supplement the 
weaknesses of another. Where one teammate may have fallen short on rhythm near the 
conclusion of a race, for example, another teammate would provide a blazing final 'kick'. 
Equipped with a transformative understanding of team dynamics, I ultimately came to 
realize that cooperative achievement arises not from compromise, but rather from the 
constructive amalgamation of distinctive individual qualities. 
As I toe the starting line of an undefined future, I will undoubtedly carry these indelible 
lessons with me throughout the entirety of life's most daunting race."
50,"Sweaty from the hot lights, the feeling of nervousness and excitement return as I take 
my place on the 30-yard line. For 10 short minutes, everyone is watching me. The first 
note of the opening song begins, and I’m off. Spinning flags, tossing rifles, and dancing 
across the football field. Being one of only two people on the colorguard means 
everyone will see everything. It’s amazing and terrifying. And just like that, the 
performance is over. 
Flashback to almost four years ago, when I walked into the guard room for the first time. 
I saw flyers for a “dance/flag team” hanging in the bland school hallway, and because I 
am a dancer, I decided to go. This was not a dance team at all. Spinning flags and 
being part of the marching band did not sound like how I wanted to spend my free time. 
After the first day, I considered not going back. But, for some unknown reason, I stayed. 
And after that, I began to fall in love with color guard. It is such an unknown activity, and 
maybe that’s part of what captivated me. How could people not know about something 
so amazing? I learned everything about flags and dancing in that year. And something 
interesting happened- I noticed my confidence begin to grow. I had never thought I was 
that good at anything, there was always someone better. However, color guard was 
something I truly loved, and I was good at it. 
The next year, I was thrown into an interesting position. Our current captain quit in the 
middle of the season, and I was named the new captain of a team of six. At first, this 
was quite a daunting task. I was only a sophomore, and I was supposed to lead people 
two years older than me? Someone must’ve really believed in me. Being captain 
sounded impossible to me at first, but I wouldn’t let that stop me from doing my best. 
This is where my confidence really shot up. I learned how to be a captain. Of course I 
was timid at first, but slowly, I began to become a true leader. 
The next marching season, it paid off. I choreographed many pieces of our show, and 
helped teach the other part of my guard, which at the time was only one other person. 
Having a small guard, we had to be spectacular, especially for band competitions. We 
ended up winning first place and second place trophies, something that had never been 
done before at our school, especially for such a small guard. That season is still one of 
my favorite memories. The grueling hours of learning routines, making changes, and 
learning how to be a leader finally paid off. 
Looking back on it as I exit the field after halftime once again, I am so proud of myself. 
Not only has color guard helped the band succeed, I’ve also grown. I am now confident 
in what my skills are. Of course there is always more to be done, but I now I have the 
confidence to share my ideas, which is something I can’t say I had before color guard. 
Every Friday night we perform, I think about the growth I’ve made, and I feel on top of 
the world. That feeling never gets old."
51,"Growing up in the former Soviet Union with poor healthcare, my maternal 
grandmother died at the young age of 48, a victim of metastatic melanoma. My mother 
was just 18 years old. As I grew up, she would constantly talk about my grandmother. 
The biggest thing that I remember about my grandma was her love for languages. 
Obsessed with romance languages, particularly French, she was inseparable from 
French literature, movies, and language. She was enthralled with the 
language’s sophisticated, flowing, passionate, emphatic, and radiant sound and style. I 
never heard her speak, but I can only imagine the charismatic and passionate scholar of 
French she was. In our living room hangs a bookshelf with approximately 200 of 
grandma’s French books. She lived with the dream to visit the City of Lights one day. 
Unfortunately, she died before she was able to fulfill her dream of traveling to Paris. 
I did not know this in seventh grade. When choosing languages to take, I thought that 
since everyone was taking Spanish, I could take French and be different. I know my 
grandma’s spirit lived on in me and guided me to take French, similar to the way dream 
but it would also expose me to a beautiful, timeless language. 
While I hold a great affinity toward French, I also hold a deep passion for the sciences. 
Last summer, I participated in Boston University’s RISE program for high school 
students. Much of the research I performed was centered around the transformation 
of recombinant DNA into Escherichia coli. As the six weeks progressed, I developed an 
affinity towards biology and genetics. My final research project was entitled: The Effect 
of Calcium on E. coli Transformed with Phosphodiesterase Type II. The experience I 
had at Boston University forged my current interest in the sciences and genetics, and 
my laboratory experiences in Boston cemented my commitment. 
My interest in biology and genetics has grown even more during the genetics unit in my 
AP Biology class. Learning about inherited genetic disorders as well as various 
inheritance patterns fascinated me, as I learned that simple, miniscule chains and 
sequences of basic nucleotides have the power to shape and influence all living 
organisms. My passion for genetics and the natural sciences has convinced me that I 
will be successful at Georgetown in a biology major. I know my studies at Georgetown 
College will further my interest in genetics and molecular biology and will instill in me the 
thinking skills required for a career in genetics. I look forward to a rewarding experience 
at Georgetown, studying both French and biology."
52,"As a child the world fascinated me. From questioning the makeup of the dirt I played in, 
to doubting the existence of gravity as I flew a kite, I was always thinking. Time passed, 
and my consciousness opened to more, like atoms, the Big Bang Theory, the 
psychology behind dreams, and the list goes on. Everything fascinated me; curiosity 
quickly became a part of my character. Some say ignorance is bliss, but I have to 
disagree. Ignorance is what fuels my curiosity; ignorance is what drives me to discover, 
learn, and initiate change. Living in a small rural town with my grandmother and 
disabled father, I have been limited by geography and socioeconomics. A perfect blend 
of humanities and factualities, the College of Arts and Sciences is an exploratory lab for 
all I do not know. At Penn, courses from Neurobiology of Learning and Memory to The 
Sociology of Gender allow me to rid my ignorance one class at a time. The unique and 
specialized curriculum provides a place to explore whatever I wonder and answer 
whatever I question. While my grandmother did not have the money for me to attend 
science camps, to visit museums, or to travel more than a few hours from my home, 
living in the country always provided me with endless exploration. My interest in trees in 
particular led me to specialize in the forestry portion of our Envirothon team for four 
years of high school. The passion I have for biology is second to my interest in helping 
others. Rural areas of Pennsylvania are in desperate need for physicians, especially in 
the field of women’s health. My goal is to return to my community and fill that need. As a 
low income, first-generation student, I have had limited opportunities, but I have seized 
any that I could and where there were none, I created some. As a seventh grader, I 
pioneered the colorguard of our newly formed high school marching band. Last year, as 
captain of 14 twirlers, I took my first plane ride to Disney World where my band 
performed. This experience taught more than I could ever learn in a classroom. 
Similarly, there are endless opportunities at Penn, both intra- and extra-curricular, and I 
plan to take advantage of all that I can to feed my fire."
53,"As I was going to St. Ives, Upon the road I met seven wives; Every wife had seven sacks, Every 
sack had seven cats: Cats, sacks, and wives, How many were going to St. Ives? 
I have three principles that define my searches for the best riddles: 1) Riddles should be tricky 
but not impossible. 2) Riddles should be shared with friends. 3) A riddle should always have a 
solution. 
Growing up, I followed these guidelines to find a treasure trove of engaging problems, 
including puzzles about doors that only tell truths and lies, prisoners in monochromatic hats, 
and of course, the aforementioned St. Ives rhyme. 
Part of what I love so much about riddles is that as difficult as they are, there is always a 
solution. Even the most confounding question has an answer that can perfectly satisfy it. 
I love to wrap my mind around the possibilities of a logic conundrum and parse through an 
intricate labyrinth of mental avenues. As a child, I enjoyed the process of solving a riddle, but 
the deepest satisfaction for me came from the end result, the acquisition of an answer unlocking 
the problem's secrets. 
Information was my favored currency in Elementary and Middle school. I enthralled my friends 
with questions in exchange for the satisfaction of possessing secrets undiscovered by any 
other. Over peanut butter and sliced ham, I assumed the role of story teller among our lunch 
group, facilitating a discussion on the particularities of a murder mystery puzzle. 
As I grew older and invariably more aware of my place in the world, I began to encounter new 
types of riddles. Unlike my playful games and puzzles that existed in their own vacuums of 
imagined space, these questions encroached on major world issues with deep implications on 
society as a whole. 
Is language inherently limiting as a form of expression? How do we uphold the marginalized 
without sacrificing the majority? Are aliens real? 
The riddles of life were not as straightforward as the puzzles in my books and websites. In fact, 
they were not straightforward at all, like winding mazes of philosophical quandary. 
As is my nature to ask questions, it is also my nature to at least attempt to answer them, even if 
they have already faced the mental battering of minds far greater than my own. Diving into 
books, websites, and documentaries, I pulled apart cotton-candy strings of possibilities. 
One of the most thought-provoking subjects that preoccupies my mind regards the existence of 
aliens. Initially, my mind was settled on the possibility of intelligent life. A universe so big could 
not possibly be lifeless. 
However, my research on this subject has led me in a different direction. The contradictions 
between the statistical likelihood of aliens and a historical lack of contact (aka the Fermi 
Paradox) alludes to a possible scarcity or even absence of extraterrestrials. Furthermore, this 
theory has interesting implications on future environmental destruction and its role as a Great 
Filter impeding full intergalactic potential. 
The Fermi Paradox. The Hopi tribe. Group polarization. My desire for knowledge has led me to 
the farthest ends of human discovery. I have written dozens of essays, debated with friends and 
family, made endless lists of information, and evaluated and re-evaluated my opinions, always 
with the understanding that there is still more to know. 
Obviously, I have not definitively answered these questions. Obviously, I have much to 
learn. But rather than feel discouraged by the impossibilities of these problems, I am ready to 
seek the far reaches of human thought and even surpass those barriers. I have found a new 
satisfaction in life: not the achievement of a solution but simply its pursuit, the challenge of 
trying to find an answer to a question that may not even have one. 
As for the solution to the riddle at the start: 
How many were going to St. Ives? 
Just one, me."
54,"The most beautiful part of my day is when I walk. 
Every morning before school, I put on my grandmother’s plush red coat, tie my white 
Keds, and begin on a fifteen minute journey. The rhythmic motion of my limbs, the 
caress of the sunlight upon my skin, this is what guides my mind to achieve clarity. My 
mental acuity allows me to conceive fascinating ideas, to spill through the infinitudes of 
philosophical reflection, and experience captivating intrigue. 
Growing up, walking was used as a means of attaining peace in a time of instability. 
When it became painful to hear my mother fight with men I was supposed to love, my 
outdoor solace distracted the pain from amplifying. While gazing upon some classic 
Virginia evergreens, I questioned. 
Why do some stars end up as black holes? What makes my eyes dark blue? How do 
owls turn their heads all the way back? 
I dared to find explanations, letting my tiny fingers tear through pages of astrophysics 
books and biology encyclopedias. I drowned in documentaries about the stars and 
studied YouTube videos of violinists playing Paganini. And when my grandparents 
came to visit me during times of hardship, I asked them about ballet and music and 
DNA, thirsting to discover my breathtaking world. 
As a result of my flourishing inquisitiveness, I inevitably developed a fascination with my 
family that encouraged me to learn about my family’s walks. These were not walks in 
the purely literal sense, but rather walks generated by journeying life itself. My mother 
and grandmother’s encounter with oppression and assault while living in Iran aroused in 
me a fierce fervor for combating evil. Yet my adoptive father and grandfather’s 
encounters with plummeting aircrafts and chemical weapon attacks instilled an intense 
wonder about the psychological and moral implications of war. Moreover, these 
experiences intensified my thirst for learning and a desire to become a positive 
contributor to our ever-competitive global society. To quench this thirst, I submerged 
myself in my own ocean of intellectually invigorating walks. 
These walks have provided me invaluable experiences: I have toured the streets of 
Nuremberg with Hegel, idolizing his ideas on human consciousness. But I have glided 
across the glossy tiles of Hwa Chong Institute with my Singaporean research partners, 
latching onto the scientific complexity that drips from their lips. I have trudged past the 
mud-brick houses of Tehran with my great-uncle, marvelling at the blossoming political 
intellectualism within Iranian artists. Yet I have shrunk my frame into the dimensions of 
my pHEMA-VP hydrogel nanoparticles, exploring its polymeric networks with excitement 
and awe. 
My movement has fueled my hunger to learn more about biology, my desire for my 
cosmetic business to excel, my romance with learning political philosophy. This 
movement, this is what defines me. Indeed, my walks have also taught me how my 
intellectual endeavors satiate my love for the journey more than for the destination. For 
it is the pursuit of knowledge, with all its undulations, which electrifies the lover of 
wisdom more than the knowledge itself. 
In fact, arriving at my destinations have often provided my spirit a sharp, bittersweet 
sting. Like the stub end of a cucumber, I have tasted the unpleasantness of departing 
the people who have taught me and the experiences which have coached me: time has 
grinned at me with a gleam of schadenfreude. But I have also savored the sweet, ironic 
enlightenment that destinations provide: there is no end to my experiments in life. I will 
never cease to develop inwardly. My life is one that has converted the pursuit of 
intellectual endeavors from the machine of my destiny into the servant of my will. Walks 
have taught me to be patient, but to also live passionately and authentically. With my 
plush red coat and white Keds, I walk onward, for the wisdom of life is gained by 
walking through life itself."
55,"In my junior year microeconomics class, my teacher extensively explored the ways in 
which people from different socioeconomic classes were affected by our economic 
system. I was frustrated by the ways our country forces those living in poverty to spend 
the little money they have on taxable goods. I began to empathize with them. How can 
people pull themselves out of poverty if their government seems to be working against 
them? More than anything, I was frustrated that I felt powerless to help them in any way. 
Those lessons inspired and motivated me. I had always looked at economics as nothing 
more than an analysis of business models and resource allocation. I began to see it as 
a way to fix fundamental problems in our society, from examining the effects of 
healthcare expansion on crime and poverty rates to studying how shifts in our political 
climate affect how our country’s financial process will change. I now see economics as 
a way to help those in need in my country and throughout the world. 
I volunteered after school for Representative Dingell and had the opportunity to attend 
numerous events hosted by the Ford School. Again and again, I was impressed by the 
extent of the Ford School’s student involvement in critical issues. Through my work with 
the Congresswoman, I was able to gain a greater understanding of how different groups 
of people were affected by shifts in political and economic priorities. My goal is to 
become a civil rights attorney or study economics as a way to promote sustainable 
growth in developing nations. 
I want to begin my studies at the University of Michigan in LSA to gain a foundation in 
economics and political science-related courses. After my first year, I hope to gain 
admission to the Ford School. The connections that LSA and Ford have to Poverty 
Solutions solidified by interest in the University of Michigan. If I attended these schools 
as an undergraduate student, I would be able to assist with research on the causes and 
ramifications of poverty. Professor Michael Barr’s research on policy initiatives and our 
financial system is fascinating from the perspective of a prospective economics major. 
At the University of Michigan, I would be able to join teams of renowned researchers 
working toward the betterment of our society and our world. 
The range of schools working in connection with Poverty Solutions is evidence of the 
University’s devotion to civic engagement. I would be able to participate in 
groundbreaking research regarding issues I am interested in; I would have the ability to 
study poverty and ways to stunt or alleviate its effects in other countries. As someone 
hoping to pursue a career in public service, it is truly incredible to have the opportunity 
to join a research community specifically geared toward solving problems I am 
passionate about solving. 
I want to join the University of Michigan’s legacy of innovators. I want to be part of the 
LSA community, studying economics and political science. I want to attend the Ford 
School and understand how policy in America and abroad has an effect on global 
poverty. I want to be involved with the Poverty Solutions Initiative, conducting 
groundbreaking research on the ways we can reform our financial system to better 
serve the lower and middle classes."
56,"Holton is my best friend. He may be a bit worn down, but he is an old soul with a story 
to tell. With him, I have enjoyed Russian folklore, romantic escapades, and renowned 
classics. With him, I have succeeded and failed. At times, we have had arguments, but 
when I look back on our time together, it’s the magical moments that resound. When I 
moved schools, I lost contact with many of my old friends, but I never lost Holton. 
At first, I was a bit hesitant about our relationship, but my teacher advised me that 
Holton and I would grow into great friends if we just gave each other a chance. How 
could I say no? Since then, I have never looked back. We have taken trips to New York 
City every weekend, with each passing day bringing a new adventure. 
Eventually, people began to express worry that all the time we spent together would 
hinder my academics and hold me back from other pursuits; I didn’t care. Nothing could 
break our bond. 
Sometimes I reminisce about the day I first met Holton. The old adage goes, gold is first 
and silver is second. With Holton, this notion was turned upside down. When I walked 
into the shop, it was all gold. It was as if King Midas had touched everything in the store. 
However, something out of the corner of my eye caught my attention. Was that a silver 
among the golds? He is not your standard image of perfection without that golden shine. 
However, I knew not to judge anything at face value but rather by the story that it tells; it 
was this silver horn that possessed the hauntingly golden sound. 
Holton is my french horn. Not a shiny new one, but one that has travelled far and 
experienced much. He has been with me under the bright lights of Lincoln Center and 
Peter Jay Sharp Theater, and has always given my right arm a good workout as I carry 
him from class to class, rehearsal to rehearsal, performance to performance. 
Through Holton, I have experienced failure. My failed New Jersey Youth Symphony 
audition as a sixth grader fueled my motivation to practice harder. I still remember my 
dried lips, cracked notes, and missed entrances. Such failures invariably led to 
success. Acceptance into the Juilliard Pre-College program will always be one of my 
happiest memories. However, no success comes without sacrifice. In my early 
childhood, I participated in every activity that I liked. Basketball, choir, piano...if I 
enjoyed it, I did it. Mandatory all-day attendance every Saturday at Juilliard with my 
friend Holton in company, meant I had to give up some other things that I loved. I could 
no longer be a part of the New Jersey Youth Chorus, the beloved choir in which I had 
sung for seven years. I would not be able to try out for freshman basketball, one of my 
high school goals. I would not be able to participate on the debate team in earnest, 
something that I fell in love in my freshman year. But Holton has been worth these 
sacrifices and more. 
The journey I am experiencing with him more than makes up for anything else I had to 
give up, and I cannot wait to continue our journey in my college years. 
Soon, my high school experience will be over, and as I bid adieu to the friendly walls 
of [School], I will hit the road to wherever this application process takes me. Among all 
the suitcases in the trunk will be a black, worn-down horn case; inside will be Holton, 
ready for more adventures. Many college-bound seniors wish for good roommates. I 
know that in Holton I will have, at the very least, one great one. He will always hold a 
special place in my life and in my heart as my first prize silver."
57,"The University of Michigan’s College of Engineering has a proactive approach to career 
path discovery and job search. While I do hope to aspire to a corporate attorney, an 
engineering degree from the University of Michigan would provide me the advantage of 
readiness. 
U.S News and World Report published an article about challenges law school 
applicants with STEM degrees face. Number one was the lack of research skills. 
Michigan Undergraduate Engineering has research opportunities for all undergraduate 
students. I hope to even take advantage of The College of Engineering (CoE) 
International Internship Program. The chance to see the world and contribute to the 
world-class studies conducted by Michigan Engineering students is a unique quality. 
The article also reported that STEM applicants often lack job experience. Michigan 
Engineering hosts internship fairs, which even freshman can participate in. By utilizing 
the opportunity to work in a professional setting, I will be more adapt to presenting 
myself in a mature and respectable manor in a corporate setting. 
Many people are puzzled by my aspirations to become a corporate lawyer with an 
engineering degree. While I enjoy learning about many areas of study, math and 
science have always peaked my interest. Like my attraction to law, I am drawn to the 
definitiveness of engineering specifically. While there is a right and wrong in methods 
and procedures, there is a chance to be creative; for the end goal is functionality. Law 
requires critical thinking, problem solving, and the questioning of presented facts and 
figures. These skills are also encompassed in Michigan Engineering. With a technical 
understanding of industry and engineering, I will be able to more accurately represent a 
corporation. Like the professors at Michigan Engineering, I hope to be an expert in my 
field. At Michigan Engineering, I will be educated by the best of the best. Professors that 
have been exposed to their fields in every aspect; allowing them to provide the best 
guidance to students. Instead of just presenting facts and figures in a courtroom, I will 
be able to understand and explain them."
58,"Living in a suburb my whole life, I've always felt as if I lived in a two-dimensional plane. I 
can go left, right, forward, and backward. 
In a suburb, however, it is nearly impossible to get any meaningful altitude. Upon 
visiting New York City during the summer before my senior year, however, I found 
myself gazing up at the skyscrapers soaring high above me. I've always loved the views 
mountains and buildings; both from above and below. I also have spent time studying 
Mandarin, and Shanghai would offer a unique opportunity to further my linguistic studies 
while engaging in cultural immersion. 
Beyond settings, NYU has the capacity and the resources available for me to engage in 
research in quantum computation. Playing video games got me into math and science 
beyond just playing with my calculator as a baby. There were practical applications of 
the numbers, and I wanted to understand how it all worked in order to get the best 
equipment and maximize ammo efficiency. I would watch ""Mythbusters"" and try to come 
up with my own hypothesis and see if it matched their conclusion. 
In 8th grade, I figured out that I loved science along with math, but I didn't exactly know 
what science I loved. At the time I was in ""physical science"" and I did enjoy the class a 
lot, but I always thought of physics as ""speed distance time"" triangles which were no fun 
at all. I was convinced to take AP Physics in my junior year with my friends, and I loved 
it. It was almost every week we would learn something that completely altered my 
perception of the universe. 
Once I learned about quantum physics and how it basically destroys our understanding 
of everything, I knew I wanted to pursue it further, and be at the forefront of quantum 
research. 
At NYU, not only can I take courses to learn about the subject, but I can also participate 
in research through the ""Center for Quantum Phenomena"". Taking advanced courses 
and conducting research in a new setting, such as New York or Shanghai, can offer me 
a new perspective and a breath of fresh air. Conversely, I can help over NYU a new 
perspective on critical thinking and problem-solving. I chose to apply to NYU because 
NYU is fit for me, and I am fit for NYU."
59,"The night before I climb to the summit, I pack my bag carefully, making sure all my 
equipment is in its rightful place. Headlamp in the left pocket. Clif Bar (nauseating but 
necessary) next to my sleeping bag. Three unlocked carabiners on my harness. Extra 
layers, ropes, and ice axes diligently packed away. After a few hours of sleep, I wake up 
under the midnight moon, my brain foggy in the high altitude and grateful for the extra 
preparation. 
Although I would love to say this sense of organization comes naturally, it only became 
habit after my first major mountaineering expedition. The summer after freshman year, I 
flew to Washington to climb Mt. Adams, a lofty 12,000-foot peak in the shadow of 
Rainier. My backpacking, rock climbing, and skiing experience gave me the technical 
skills I would need for mountaineering, which is essentially a combination of those three 
sports. But physical skills alone could not compensate for the logistical skills I 
lacked. Just twenty minutes before starting the climb, I scrambled to pack under the 
faint beam of my headlamp. My one a.m. brain betrayed me; I left all my food at base 
camp. I climbed as far as I could, but had to descend to camp before long. It was not 
safe for me to continue on without food. 
This anecdote was not unique to one summit attempt, or the outdoors in general. In 
middle school, I constantly neglected to make flashcards and write down homework, 
and my grades, though good, suffered as a result. I left behind a trail of forgotten ski 
coats and misplaced textbooks, and few were surprised when parent-teacher 
conferences revolved around the word ‘careless’. But after that failed summit attempt, I 
created organizational systems for every subsequent kayaking, hiking, and 
mountaineering trip, and began to apply them beyond the trailhead. While high school 
isn’t exactly comparable to climbing mountains, I pack my backpack the night before, 
make flashcards weeks before tests, and always stash extra snacks for cross country. 
The preparation steals a few precious minutes of sleep, but in return, means honors 
societies and academic excellence. 
These processes have led to academic success, but weren’t without flaw. I spent hours 
preparing for each challenge, and in return expected an A on every test and a 
successful summit of each mountain. I felt that the outcome should be in exact 
proportion to my effort. I failed to recognize that I can’t control every variable. Heading 
into a difficult summit attempt of Mount Olympus, the tallest peak in Washington’s 
Olympic Range, I was certain it would go my way. I was in great shape, had practiced 
all my knots and rope skills, and, of course, had packed the night before. Despite it 
being the most difficult mountain, I had attempted, I thought that due to the work I had 
put in, it was my right to summit. I was wrong. 
The glacier leading up to the summit was calving, or shedding ice, too quickly. These 
glacial avalanches would be deadly, there was no other way to the summit, and it was 
totally out of my control. I was devastated. We ate Snickers, normally enjoyed on the 
summit, on the glacier staring up at the peak. Below our feet, swimming through the 
glacial crevasses, were ice worms: tiny, endemic invertebrates. I transformed my 
disappointment into an opportunity to slow down and research glaciers and their tiny 
microorganisms. Looking back, I’m not upset I didn’t summit. I learned about ice worms 
and watermelon snow algae, but more importantly that while I can’t control every 
outcome, I can always control my attitude. I won’t reach the peak of every mountain, 
ace every test, or win every cross-country race, no matter how hard I prepare. But I can 
do my best, enjoy the process, and embrace the outcome, even if it’s not exactly what I 
expected."
60,"If you are not the first, you are one of the rest. I always thought this was the key to 
happiness. Even when I was an infant, my mom used to say that I chose the people 
who could carry me. There were only two people: my mom and my sister, not even my 
dad. 
Growing up, I always wanted to be the best in everything. And I was for the most part. I 
have a bunch of certificates: first in elocution competition, debates, patriotic song 
competitions, fancy dress, story narration, top 1% in the Macmillan math Olympiad, etc. 
In all the parent-teacher meetings, every teacher would say that my parents were 
blessed to have such a child and no one else stood a chance. 
Everything went great until I came second in the fifth grade in the annual examination. I 
just could not admit that I got defeated, that someone else was better than me. As the 
middle school period is when “who is the prettiest girl in class” came up, I lost there as 
well. Since that mattered a lot during the puberty stage, that cost me my confidence. I 
stopped talking to my friends because I thought they had this perception of me being 
ugly. It went to such an extent that I thought my parents felt the same way, so I’d never 
let them attend the parent-teacher meetings. I stopped participating in many activities. 
Then the ultimate burst: my sister, the one whom I’d let hold me, moved to the United 
States. That was the rock bottom; I felt so lonely and lost. I just isolated myself because 
I felt so insecure. I was afraid to be with myself. Still, I lingered on and immersed myself 
in something I knew I was good at and did not have to be social: academics. Then came 
the eighth grade. This was the most crucial period of my life. Just keep reading and 
you’ll know why. 
This was when I was introduced to programming, and since I was always inclined to 
problem-solving and logical analysis, I was fascinated. When I could solve the problems 
my tutor gave me, I felt like I was solving problems in my real life and started to regain 
control (as I was when I was a baby). That’s how my passion for programming started. I 
delved further into this. This made me come out of that pitch-black pit. In my tenth-grade 
board exam, I was one among the few to get the perfect score in computer science. But 
I wasn’t ready to let this go after the tenth grade. I gave up a relaxed life for the Android 
development classes during my tenth-grade summer vacations. 
When I published my first app in the Google play store, I realized that this was the 
happiest I had ever been. So, does it make you happy if you are the best at 
everything? When was I the happiest— when I was the best at everything or when I was 
programming? The truth is that the former happiness was fleeting. It was for those few 
words of my teachers or my peers, but the latter was real. It’s true, that was harder to 
achieve but when I did come past all those little runtime errors and crashes, it made my 
day. So, the answer to the question is ‘no’. What makes you happy is you pursuing your 
passion. 
The outcome: my attitude towards life changed. Nothing could pull me down anymore. 
Even if I didn’t top my class, I was happy because I knew my happiness was 
independent. The sheer spirit of chasing my dreams makes me happy. I will work hard 
to achieve them. You create your own destiny."
61,"You are 7 years old. A girl you are trying to befriend tells you that she does not want to be 
friends with you because your eyes are “ugly and squinty.” Hot tears run down your face 
because you do not understand the reason for her ugly words. 
You are 13 years old. It is Halloween and on Instagram you see two of your classmates 
dress up as Asians. Their faces are painted yellow and their eyes are pulled back with tape. 
The caption reads, “can’t find the dogs to eat with our eye slits!” People ask if you are 
offended. You do not want to be seen as uptight so you laugh it off. Numerous incidents like 
these dot your childhood. You do not want to be Asian anymore. You hate your hideous 
Asian face. 
I had always been shy as a kid and the environment I was raised in only exacerbated my 
growing insecurities. My school’s population was 99% white, so I had no friends of my own 
ethnicity and often faced the brunt of people’s ignorance. In middle school, everyone 
suddenly started caring about looks. I wanted so badly to look like my Caucasian 
classmates and worked tirelessly to try to erase my “Asian” features. I bleached my hair 
and skin. I glued my eyelids into double folds and wore eye-enlarging contacts. I spent 
countless hours researching plastic surgeons that could “Westernize” my looks. I was 
utterly obsessed with how others perceived me. My insecurities were loud, and they 
attracted unwanted attention from other students who bullied me. 
At this point I lacked friends in real life and began to find solace on the internet, my 
getaway from the burdens of real life. People could not judge me based on how I looked, 
only by my words. I was playing an online game where I met my first Asian friend, Ethan. 
He had a pride in his ethnicity I never had. After getting to know me better, Ethan asked 
why I tried so hard to reject my heritage. He wanted to know why I never showed my 
face. Over time, on the internet, I started to meet more people of my ethnicity who became 
my role models and cherished friends. 
After constant reflection and studying psychology, I began to understand my past in a new 
light. The ignorant people who ridiculed me faced stress and insecurity in their own 
lives that spurred their actions. Thereafter, I was able to come to the realization that has 
since then freed me of my insecurities: every person who passes by me is living a life just as 
vivid and complex as my own, with their own thoughts and perceptions; everyone has their 
own image of me in their head, and because none are a fully correct representation of who I 
am, I should not be concerned with trying to modify them. And what I learned from the 
hours I resided immersed on the internet was that what defines me is not my looks, but 
what I have to say. My life was not mine if I cared constantly about what others thought. 
The internet was my catalyst for change, and slowly, I started to blossom. Fear of 
judgement had once stopped me from seeking opportunities, and I sought to change that. I 
began to branch out and engage with new people. My makeup was no longer a mask, but 
instead a tool I used to enhance the features that I now love. I am proud of my unique 
features and refuse to let anyone make me feel the way I used to feel. Though I will never 
be able to erase the scarred little girl from my past, I would not want to because she has 
made me strong from what she endured. I want to be Asian."
62,"Inside every bedroom is the Swiss Army knife of the sleeping world: blankets. You can 
take them with you anywhere and they always come in handy. My blankets are dark 
blue with square tribal patterns, knitted from the finest pima cotton by Peruvian artisans. 
I fluff them up for a soft snuggle, throw them over myself to deter the monsters under 
the bed, or use them as a ShamWow for tears. Yet they also helped me overcome the 
biggest obstacle—the moving target— in my life. 
I’ve moved within and between countries ten times. I’ve changed schools so often 
that I’ve never been in a classroom for more than two years. I have felt loneliness and 
isolation, while my classmates had playdates and tea parties in a language I struggled 
to speak. Nothing was mine, not in school where local kids decorated their lockers, not 
in our rented house where everything belonged to the landlord, and not in the bedroom I 
slept in, where furniture and wall colors constantly switched from cream to light tan to 
stale beige. 
The only thing that followed me from house to house were my two blankets. 
As I started middle school, I began to resent moving. I took my anger out on my 
parents, despising them for ripping me away from newly made friends, the eighth-grade 
boyfriend who held my hand and gifted me Godiva chocolates, and the bedroom 
overlooking the Via Paloma, whose bare, white walls and street noises were beginning 
to feel familiar. I had no safe space or anchor to rely on when new cultures and 
languages overwhelmed me. 
As I finished middle school, my dark blue blankets were brimming with tears of anger 
and frustration. One night I rolled myself up into a pitiful cocoon of ill-thoughts and 
sadness, closed my eyes, and inhaled deeply. The scent of clean cotton swirled inside 
my lungs, relaxing me. Memories morphed: The spacious apartment in the Andes 
mountains of Venezuela, the cozy cabin in the hills of Peru, and the lush single story 
homes in Palm Beach and Miami. Each stop carried its own memories like a distinctive 
aroma. I remembered the first hike along the Andean mountains in Caracas, sliding 
down the sand dunes in Lima, and savoring deep fried Oreos at the South Florida Fair. 
A nostalgic smile formed on my face as I continued to remember. 
In retrospect, moving was my passport to exciting new ideas, tastes, and hobbies. I 
lived through vastly different cultures, and over the course of my country-hopping 
journey, I blended them to create a unique lifestyle of arroz con pollo, salsa, and Costco 
bulk shopping. I was exposed to new angles on belief and opinions, which opened my 
eyes to the diverse perspectives of the world. Changes of place, language and 
altitude have gifted me with an open-minded and thoughtful nature. 
My blankets have followed me to every new home, to every new bedroom. They were 
my emotional anchors when I felt adrift, they were my safe harbors. They reminded me 
that it’s not important to own everything around you to feel in control of your own life. It’s 
okay for things to change, as long as you hang on to your values. The battle between 
bare white and dark blue has shaped me into a person that can accept and adapt to 
unfamiliar situations. 
I’ll haul my weathered blankets to new adventures and apartments, hopefully to the 
foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains and the gritty streets of East LA. Wherever I go, I 
can count on them to wrap me in their familiar arms, making the undiscovered feel like 
home."
63,"As a child who hid behind her parents and never uttered a word whenever strangers were near, 
I was no stranger to people deeming me shy. As I got older, however, I found my voice more 
comfortably through music, through art, and through writing. 
Playing Mozart’s Violin Concerto in the Kennedy Center, for instance, unleashed a swell of 
emotions through the intricate art of storytelling with my violin. I was drawn to writing stories and 
sharing ideas with my peers, starting my editor career in fifth grade. Five years later, I co-
founded my high school’s literary magazine, Muses, which provides a platform for all 
voices while fostering connections among students. 
I was twelve years old when a HTML class through John Hopkins University’s Center for 
Talented Youth program introduced me to a modern language of communication: computers 
and the Internet. Falling in love with coding and website design, I utilized my newfound 
knowledge to design a website for my National History Day project, which won the school 
competition. In high school, I joined programming club, took the rigorous computer science 
classes, and designed Muses’ website. This year, I created a conceptual online boutique store, 
which won first place in Maryland Future Business Leader Association’s E-business competitive 
event. 
In the summer of [Date], I interned in a NCI melanoma research lab. This 
experience completed changed how I viewed the importance of technology to modern 
communication. We had obtained genotypes from thousands of melanoma patients and 
controls, but a new question arose: how could we extract the useful information from a massive 
data file, akin to finding a needle in a haystack? Under the guidance of a bioinformatician, I 
performed an association test between melanoma associated variants and survival outcome to 
identify the risk loci that might affect patient survival. 
Catering to the needs of the scientists, I wrote an app by R code that organizes and manages 
melanoma genotype information; extracting the information of a particular genotype and its 
association with melanoma was now a couple clicks away. From this work, I learned how to 
translate large data into solutions, while using the correct data format and data structure. I 
realized that modern technology not only helps us communicate more efficiently, but also 
provides a system upon which we can solve global problems. 
With a strong background in computer science and communications, I hope to incorporate both 
into a future career of building data systems, conducting research, and consulting for 
organizations that serve underrepresented citizens. 
One project I want to tackle is the modification of social media algorithms so that media created 
by minorities and/or for minorities will appear on users’ radars. The algorithm would analyze the 
user’s demographics and deliver news relevant to those traits, such as discoveries about Asian 
health issues showing up on Asian users’ feeds. Carnegie Mellon’s encouragement of 
interdisciplinary studies under the Information Systems major would allow me to accomplish this 
and so much more. As someone who attacks calculus and creative writing with equal 
enthusiasm, IS’ objective of providing students with a broad background in the humanities and 
sciences is very appealing. As someone who learned to work as a team in a research lab, 
CMU’s emphasis on collaboration and student innovation would push me to further improve my 
teamwork and problem-solving skills. 
In particular, I hope to take advantage of CMU’s Technology Consulting in the Global 
Community program, receiving guidance from both CMU’s renowned faculty and international 
technology experts. To that end, the Social and Decision Sciences major, my second choice, 
would also prepare me to utilize similar decision-making and analysis skills to solve social 
problems. 
We live in a world where communication through technology connects communities across the 
globe, more so than ever before. The future of exploration and innovation requires us to develop 
efficient ways of communication - we need a combination of scientific expertise and knowledge 
grounded in the humanities to accurately convey ideas, solve problems and make the planet a 
better home for us all. An education at Carnegie Mellon would propel me in this endeavor."
64,"“And you thought you could paint,” whispered the indistinguishable mass of colors in 
front of me, which was meant to represent a window. I looked down at the paint-stained 
printed image that I held with my trembling hand and back again to the unsuccessful 
attempts I had made to capture it on the canvas. My eyes scanned the wet paint 
avidly, attempting to find a solution to a problem I didn’t, couldn’t, solve. The more I 
looked at it, the more my mind wandered, focusing on the imperfections and confusion 
that the task of creating my first oil painting caused. Thoughts dashed through my brain 
like bullets, creating a knot of insecurity so tight that all of the pressure seemed to 
accumulate until I couldn’t hold it any longer. The pressure exploded, followed by 
several fat tears that spurted from my eyes. “Why would you do something you’re 
clearly not good at?” yelled my thoughts. I dropped my paintbrush on the floor, the paint 
splattering around me along with my tears. 
I had never encountered anything like the painting that lay in front of me. My little 
projects were generally characterized by the quick learning of new skills, after which I 
would easily succeed at achieving in the activity. Never had I struggled solving math 
problems, never had my words faltered while conjuring up a last minute essay. It was 
this previous success and my ability to learn things quickly that made this encounter 
with a challenge so difficult. When looking at an obstacle in the eyes, I was a coward. I 
was unable to face difficulty in the fear that I’d be unable to succeed. I turned around 
and walked away, the smell of wet paint fading along with the determination my eyes 
had once held. 
The colors would remain alone for the next few weeks, calling to me from the corner of 
my bedroom where they lay, discarded. It was not until that cloudy Sunday afternoon, 
common during rainy season, when the voices would finally reach my ears and guide 
my hands back to the paintbrush. It would take, however, 3 weeks and the development 
of a new friendship. 
I met Mirjana through an exchange programme between my school and a school hidden 
amongst the mountains of Panama, which aimed at providing a better education 
to teens from poor areas. She was pretty and soft-spoken, with white teeth and 
sparkling, brown eyes. She liked to read, and we hit it off right away. Her stay with us 
was filled with laughter and discussions about latin-american novelists, and it was 
amongst these that we grew to become the best of friends. Mirjana told me about her 
hobbies, her friends from back home, her dreams, but most of all, her fears. 
We spent long afternoons in bed, the soft breeze outside creating twists in our hair as it 
crawled through the window and listened to our conversations, the rain’s silent 
messenger during April. Mirjana told me about her fear of not being able to provide for 
her family and her homesickness while being at boarding school. It was during these 
conversations about fear that I began to look back at my painting attempts. Fear, that 
little whisper on the back of my ear, the fear of failure, had stopped me in my tracks 
when I had encountered a setback. 
Our conversations during these calm afternoons continued, and my thoughts about the 
fear of failure intensified. Why was failure so scary to me? Why was I afraid of 
something I had not yet encountered? These thoughts would reach a climax that cloudy 
Sunday afternoon, where my hands would find the paintbrush and dip it into the creamy 
mixture of oil paint. And although I did learn how to paint, my biggest achievement was 
learning how to push fear out of the way to let the water flow and the paint dance."
65,"My head was contorted to the left in a painful, awkward position in which the tip of my 
head brushed the top of my chest. It was as if a puppeteer had gained control of my 
now jerky, wooden-like legs; I could not walk without aid. My whole body was so weak 
that simple movements like lifting a glass of water exhausted me. Therefore, I had to be 
fed, bathed, and clothed as if I was an infant. My speech was extremely slurred and 
incomprehensible. The physical problems were not what destroyed me the most, 
however; my mental cognition was severely inhibited. I could not successfully read, 
write, or even keep up with simple plots of television shows. Everything moved too fast 
for me. I’d just finished learning about complex trig identities, and I now couldn't even 
count to ten! 
I’d developed a sudden, severe, rare form of dystonia just after my junior prom, but I 
have never believed in the quote “Where there’s a will, there’s a way” more than during 
my miraculous recovery, which revealed that my illness occurred to encourage me to 
stretch my supposed limitations in life’s journey. 
My high school principal froze my grades where they were at, but my mother had to 
contact the college I was dual enrolled with to extend the time to take my French and 
trig finals. I’d doubted I could even pass my finals due to my current cognitive state. My 
friends and family held back tears when they visited me. Their eyes stared at my stark 
white neck brace and awkward limbs, and their ears strained to comprehend my 
unintelligible speech. I did not react. I could not react. I felt like an empty shell of a 
human because I could not feel any kind of emotion—happiness, anger, fear, or 
sadness. I was simply being. Precious values my parents instilled in me–to maintain my 
faith and to crave the expansion of my knowledge– were gone. Prescribed medicine 
relieved my pain, but the various neurologists I’d seen could not determine how long I 
would be in this state; I believed God wanted me to be mentally and physically 
handicapped for the rest of my life. 
Then one day, after many hazy days of nothingness and being unaware of the passage 
of time, my mother asked me morosely if I would like to enroll in an online school or 
drop out of school altogether since my condition was not improving. Her words echoed 
in my mind, and I was immediately drawn out of my vegetative state because I was 
horrified at the potential reality of my dreams being crushed from something I had no 
control over. I refused to accept my supposed fate. 
I was the one thing in life I had control over. 
Every day, I exercised my legs by taking my dogs outside, checking the mailbox, and 
walking around my room. Instead of watching new shows or reading books, since I 
could not keep up, I watched movies that I’d regularly watched to practice reading 
subtitles and interpreting information. Who would’ve thought that Walt Disney’s Tarzan 
and Pixar’s Bee Movie would be some of the most vital tools of my healing process? 
For my trig class, numbers appeared to be Latin. However, after many weeks, I finally 
was able to solve problems and learn at the original rate I did before I got sick. As for 
French, I studied it every day to combat my weakened recall. Eventually, towards the 
end of the summer, I took my finals and aced them, and this success encouraged me to 
continue to strive for more successes, varying from learning new French words every 
day to starting my own music business. From my sickness, I realized that even the 
darkest points of your life occur for a reason, and any success begins with a powerful, 
true sense of self-determination."
66,"I began attending boarding school aged nine. 
Obviously, this is not particularly unusual – my school dorms were comprised of boys and girls in the 
same position as me. However, for me it was difficult – or perhaps it was for all of us; I don’t know. We 
certainly never discussed it. 
I felt utterly alone, as though my family had abruptly withdrawn the love and support thatI so desperately 
needed. At first, I did try to open up to them during weekly phone calls, but what could they do? As 
months slipped by, the number of calls reduced. I felt they had forgotten me. Maybe they felt I had 
withdrawn from them. A vast chasm of distance was cracking open between us. 
At first, I shared my hurt feelings with my peers, who were amazingly supportive, but there was a limit to 
how much help they could offer. After a while, I realized that by opening up, I was 
burdening them, perhaps even irritating them. The feelings I was sharing should have been reserved for 
family. So, I withdrew into myself. I started storing up my emotions and became a man of few words. In 
the classroom or on the sports field, people saw a self-confident and cheerful character, but behind that 
facade was someone who yearned for someone to understand him and accept him as he was. 
Years went past. 
Then came the phone call which was about to change my life. “Just come home Aryan, it’s really 
important!” My mother’s voice was odd, brittle. I told her I had important exams the 
following week, so needed to study. “Aryan, why don’t you listen to me? There is no other option, 
okay? You are coming home.” 
Concerned, I arranged to fly home. When I got there, my sister didn’t say hi to me, my grandmother didn’t 
seem overly enthusiastic to see me and my mother was nowhere to be seen. I wanted to be told why I 
was called back so suddenly just to be greeted as though I wasn’t even welcome. 
Then my mother then came out of her room and saw me. To my immense incredulity, she ran to me and 
hugged me, and started crying in my arms. 
Then came the revelation, “Your father had a heart attack.” 
My father. The man I hadn’t really talked to in years. A man who didn’t even know who I was anymore. I’d 
spent so long being disappointed in him and suspecting he was disappointed in me, I sunk under a flood 
of emotions. 
I opened the door to his room and there he was sitting on his bed with a weak smile on his face. I felt 
shaken to my core. All at once it was clear to me how self-centered I had become. A feeling 
of humiliation engulfed me, but finally I realized that rather than wallow in it, I needed to appreciate I was 
not alone in having feelings. 
I remained at home that week. I understood that my family needed me. I worked with my uncle to ensure 
my family business was running smoothly and often invited relatives or friends over to cheer my father up. 
Most importantly, I spent time with my family. It had been years since I’d last wanted to do this – I had 
actively built the distance between us – but really, I’d never stopped craving it. Sitting together in the living 
room, I realized how badly I needed them. 
Seeing happiness in my father’s eyes, I felt I was finally being the son he had always needed me to be: A 
strong, capable young man equipped to take over the family business if need be."
67,"My favorite class in high school was also my hardest. It was World Culture/World 
Literature, an hour and a half each day of seeing history, art, and literature not as 
separate entities but as intricately connected, one incomplete without the other. I 
learned to see humanism in Greek sculpture, religious propaganda in the chiaroscuro of 
Baroque paintings, disillusionment in modern art. Although seemingly unrelated to my 
STEM-leaning interests, the analytical skills I learned there would prove invaluable in 
neuroscience research. Connecting electroencephalography results to mechanisms for 
chronic pain relief wasn’t all too different from drawing links between historical 
movements and paintings; both required an intimate knowledge of background 
information and a willingness to take risks, to see new relationships and forge 
unprecedented connections. 
LSA embodies precisely this mentality, fostering interdisciplinary learning and problem-
solving. With classes like “Health, Biology, and Society: What is Cancer?”, bridging 
humanistic and biological approaches to disease, and graduation requirements ranging 
from Natural Sciences to Race and Ethnicity, LSA prepares students for the real world, 
where problems necessitate not just single-minded expertise but also a diverse 
understanding of other factors involved. My internship experience only confirmed the 
practicality of this perspective; we used mindfulness meditation alongside spinal cord 
stimulation technologies to treat chronic pain. 
This mindset is not confined to learning inside the classroom. The LSA Opportunity Hub 
is robust, connecting students to internships at Nike, Forbes, and the US Department of 
Education, among other places. To intern as a research assistant at Mayo Clinic, to use 
mathematical models to predict brain tumor growth like current Michigan junior Tatum 
Doyle would be an unequalled opportunity. Her work in incorporating mathematical 
concepts in medical research personifies the LSA culture, where problems are best 
solved holistically. LSA’s interdisciplinary approach does not detract from fostering 
specialization and excellence in specific fields, but adds; its Biochemistry program 
promotes innovation and independence in its students and is ranked top in the nation. 
I remember boiling down cabbage with my dad to make acid/base indicators. In 
elementary school, my teacher wrote that I had been spending too much time reading 
animal books and too little time playing with other kids. I loved (and still love) all things 
living, often marvelling at the complexity of the animal kingdom, the human body, the 
organs, and the cells that were the foundation for everything else. The first time I read 
about the process of translation, of rendering mRNA into proteins, my eyes filled with 
tears; this is what I wanted to do, to apply the chemistry that had defined my childhood 
to my love of biology. 
LSA shares that passion, dedicating a plethora of resources, both intellectual and 
material, to its Biochemistry department. With equipment like atomic absorption 
spectrophotometers, classes in Endocrinology, and distinguished professors, the 
University of Michigan has everything any biochemistry undergraduate student would 
need, and much more. To research under a PI like Dr. Kopelman, winner of the J. 
William Fulbright Research Award, would be a dream fulfilled. His work in employing 5-
dimensional chemical imaging to visualize and treat tumors does what LSA does best; it 
uses an interdisciplinary approach to make academic discoveries both relevant and 
essential in the real world. It is a culture I would be honored to take part in, should I be 
accepted."
68,"When I first started seriously thinking about college during sophomore year, I didn’t 
want to go anywhere outside of Ohio. I thought I would be too far away from home. But 
the more mail I received from different colleges, the more I realized that some of my 
best opportunities were going to come from outside of my comfort zone, from outside of 
Ohio. One pamphlet from the University of Pennsylvania in particular caught my eye, 
and although I was a bit skeptical at first, as I did my research I realized that 
the University of Pennsylvania is a top tier university that holds many unique 
opportunities for its students. 
One of the first things I noticed when I began to research Penn was their emphasis on 
interdisciplinary studies. This appealed to me because I have never been interested in 
only one subject. The fact that a third of my classes would be taken outside of the 
Wharton School tells me that I will be able to explore a variety of classes in virtually any 
subject. For example, although I do not want to major in it, I have always been 
interested in computer coding. Hopefully I will able able to take some introductory level 
computer programming or coding classes at Penn even though it is not directly related 
to finance, my potential concentration. I am also excited about the availability of foreign 
languages at the University of Pennsylvania. I started learning French in eighth grade, 
and since my school only offers four years of French, I wasn’t able to take it my senior 
year, and I really miss it. I also started learning Portuguese during high school because 
I want to travel to Brazil one day. I want to continue learning both of these languages at 
the University of Pennsylvania. I am very excited about the opportunities that the 
emphasis on interdisciplinary studies will give me at Penn. 
Another aspect of Penn that I found fascinating was their different programs regarding 
political science. At one point, I wanted to major in political science. But when I took an 
Introduction to Global Politics class at the Ohio State University during the summer 
before my senior year, I didn’t know if I could honestly see myself studying that for four 
years. However, during my time researching political science at Penn, I found out about 
an amazing program that I could participate in: Penn in Washington. Political science is 
currently my second choice major, and if I decide that’s what I want to major in, it would 
be with a concentration in American Politics, so the Penn in Washington program would 
be perfect for me to find an internship and learn about how the different parts of 
government work together in the heart of America’s government. However, if I choose 
not to major in political science, I would still be interested in the American Public Policy 
minor, which is offered through the political science department in the College of Arts 
and Sciences and the Wharton School, which is where I will possibly be pursuing a 
degree in finance. Penn seems to match perfectly with what I want to study in college. I 
am really excited for the opportunities that the University of Pennsylvania will give me. 
From the interdisciplinary studies to the foreign languages and political science 
programs, I will have plenty of chances to explore my diverse interests here at the 
University of Pennsylvania."
69,"In my freshman year of high school, I had enrolled in the String Orchestra Advanced 
Class which was mixed in with the Beginning class. I was the only person with 
experience, seven years in the Violin at the time, while most of the students in the class 
were beginners. I got class elected, then re-elected as President my Freshman and 
Sophomore years, and was First Violin, then First Viola Chair. 
My first year consisted of myself and the instructor teaching the basics of each 
instrument. Learning a new instrument is frustrating, and there were times where older 
students in the class would get frustrated and unhappy that a Freshman knew more 
than they did. 
As a leader I had to make sure I did not keep a separation between myself and my 
classmates. Therefore, my Sophomore year, I changed my instrument to the Viola. 
By showing my classmates that I too was a beginner, and that I too had to learn 
because I had a new instrument -inspired the class to learn as well. My classmates no 
longer saw me as someone who told people to practice and not give up, yet did not 
have to practice or struggle themselves, but instead, as someone who was there 
practicing, and struggling along with them. 
The Orchestra program at my school started my Freshman year as an experimental 
class, but the school ended the class after my Sophomore year. Though unfortunate, in 
the two years of its existence, my classmates went from being novices, to performers, 
where in the last year of the program, we performed many times for school events and 
finally in an orchestra conference in my Sophomore year, where judges praised our 
Orchestra's technique and cohesiveness. 
After the class got cut, many of my classmates continued to pursue music 
independently, or in the District Orchestra. It is a wonderful feeling for me to see my 
former classmates -to this day- performing, and even teaching others, knowing that I 
was there when their journeys in music first began, and I look forward to seeing their 
musical pursuits in the future."
70,"Last summer I participated in molecular biology research at Boston University. 
Surrounded by 39 other high school seniors, I perceived with new clarity how an 
inquisitive, curious mind must interact in an unapologetic manner. Entering lectures 
about the basics of molecular biology, most of us initially thought we knew a great deal 
about biology. I quickly realized my naivete, and once I accepted my own ignorance, I 
settled into a passive absorption mode. The looks on all our faces told the same story. 
Well, all of ours except Kelsey’s. 
Brilliant and inquisitive, Kelsey exhibited no fear raising her hand and boldly asking 
questions. Even during the portions of the lectures when we were simply reviewing 
concepts of biology, she never ceased to question the current topic. The first few times 
she asked questions, I thought she had little background knowledge so she just needed 
clarification. Yet as the first week progressed, I realized that not only did she have the 
background information required for this course but also the grit and determination 
needed for success in research. The levels of her questions stumped our lecturer at 
times and he responded, “I’ll have to get back to you on that one.” 
Often I just wanted to yell, “PUT YOUR HAND DOWN!!!”, as my tolerance for her 
constant inquiry began to erode while sitting through her questions and their 
subsequent answers. Due to her deep and thought-provoking questions, she became 
the class pariah; not necessarily because she was annoying but because of her resolute 
and indefatigable inquisitiveness. She was insatiable in her pursuit of knowledge, like a 
ribosome clinging to the endoplasmic reticulum. 
Yet as the course progressed, I finally began to notice the value of Kelsey’s questions. 
She asked questions of importance, questions researchers must ask themselves every 
day. Her inquiries were thoughts no one else my age seemed to have. The depth and 
breadth of her ideas fascinated me, especially given that she was only sixteen. 
Kelsey’s questions made me realize the importance of questioning preconceived 
notions. 
Subsequently, I became aware of my own willingness to challenge concepts that were 
accepted and taught as seemingly concrete, and I recognized the danger of blindly 
absorbing information without disputing it. Seeing the scholarly nature of Kelsey’s 
intellectual curiosity, I began to emulate her queries during the final few weeks of the 
program. Not only did I get more out of the lectures, but I also gained the experience 
necessary to question ideas and facts and search for answers, a vital skill in every 
academic realm. 
As a student with an interest in the sciences, I ask questions that may not have an 
obvious answer. As someone who strives for knowledge, I am willing to do research if 
what I am asking has no answer, but I do not simply possess an affinity toward 
knowledge. I wish to create it. Most young people cite coaches, teachers, or other 
adults as influential; however, for me, a peer-modeled approach to learning also has 
merit."
71,"An obnoxiously red banner with Chinese characters hangs in front of a small, 
unassuming diner close to home. I stroll inside Grand Lake, this bustling hive with 
waitresses scuttling hurriedly and tables shaking lightly, the din of laughter from families 
mixing with the aromas of Chinese food. A lady with a notepad impatiently beckons my 
family to sit at one of the free tables, and as soon as we’re all settled in, she begins 
addressing me in Mandarin - possibly asking what I wanted for a drink. I look at her 
blankly, and she returns the confused expression. “I don’t speak Chinese,” I laugh 
forcibly after a tense moment. She doesn’t find the humor in my apology. From 
thereafter, our order is taken in broken English, our chopsticks switched out for the 
standard fork and knife, and I feel the burning gaze of the waitresses judging my family 
as we eat our Sunday brunch in silence. 
Cultural confusion is commonplace. Being born in Peru and raised in Venezuela makes 
no difference in how most people see and treat us. Focusing on my slanted, almond 
eyes and ebony hair, I’m automatically pegged as an Asian wherever I go. Touring 
Peruvian artisan markets is always a test of wit and cleverness, as vendors try to over-
price items we’re interested in simply because we look Asian, and therefore must also 
have Crazy Rich Asian bank accounts. Pulling out a simple credit card at a Caracas 
mall once got us chased by three armed motorcyclists on the highway, and my mother 
risked collision as she wove in and out of the cramped lanes like a Formula One race 
car driver. Since when did my appearance jeopardize my life? 
My ancestry traces back to both Chinese and Japanese roots, its imprint burrowed deep 
in my face and DNA. But I’m a third generation, Peruvian-born girl with the fire to prove 
it. Over time, our Asian culture diluted and was replaced with a vibrant, Latino lifestyle. 
With each generation, the immigrant language faded, folktales blurred, spices dulled, 
and all things Asian abandoned. I celebrated Noche Buena as a kid, not Chinese New 
Year’s. My favorite childhood dishes were anticuchos and papa huancaína, not onigiri 
rice balls or sushi rolls. Everyone assumes that I am a math prodigy, shy and antisocial, 
a black belt karate master, and a laughingstock on the dance floor. But actually, I 
struggle hardest in my math class, studying twice as much as others for the same 
grade. My personality, although sweet, is bold and gregarious. I am a three-year 
kickboxer and a five-year Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu competitor. Turn on Marc Anthony and I 
may just get a spot on So You Think You Can Dance. I’m Latina, just packed in a cute, 
little Bento box. 
There is one Asian stereotype that I fit into, even though its backstory is completely 
misguided: playing the piano. In reality, piano musician culture was not developed in 
any Asian region, rather in European countries with pioneers such as Bach and 
Haydn. Statistically, there is an equal amount of Asian and non-Asian musicians in the 
professional world. I came across the piano through my own curiosity and will, not 
through my parents bludgeoning me to play it like it’s portrayed with all young Asians. I 
actually studied South American music for an international piano competition in Peru, 
finished as a finalist, and grew to love the radiant and eccentric style of Latino modern 
music. But I digress-- my potential should be evaluated separately from my appearance. 
I am a musician born by passion, not by race. I am a human defined by my 
achievements and experiences, not physical assumptions. Leave your preconceptions 
by the welcome mat and size me up by the sound of my Rachmaninoff sonata or 
Enrique Iturriaga solos, and let my character sing your first and final impressions of me."
72,"When I was in middle school, I was bullied, and ended up falling into a deep depression. 
No one ever tried to stick up for me or befriend me. I’d like to think if someone had, 
maybe middle school would have been different for me. In high school, I decided I 
wouldn’t let anyone make me feel worthless again. But just because I wasn’t getting 
bullied didn’t mean there weren’t hundreds of kids in my school who were feeling 
victimized. I think the meaning of “to walk with others” is to protect, to nurture, and to 
share all the great things in the world that go beyond school. 
Since Freshman year, I’ve tried to sit with a different person in the lunchroom every day. 
We talk and share things that make us happy, be it stories or food! As a Senior, it might 
seem intimidating for me to sit down with a group of Freshman, but I always have a 
smile on my face, and always offer a warm hug or some advice. I try to touch every soul 
to let them know that someone is listening, since you never know what people are 
quietly going through."
73,"I recall entering the intimidating world of high school as an exorbitantly introverted, 
stereotypical Asian girl. My father urged me to assert myself and attempt new activities I 
wouldn’t have typically participated in. I didn’t want to be disappointed in twenty years 
by the things I didn’t attempt in high school, so I decided to pursue my long-time dream 
of becoming a cheerleader. I had always admired the optimism that cheerleaders had, 
and I was at a point in my life where I needed more positivity. 
I faced obstacles trying to join the team. An Asian cheerleader? But Asians were 
supposed to be smart and cheerleaders were dumb! I broke racial stereotypes by 
becoming the first Asian cheerleader in my high school. 
When I made the squad, I was exposed to individuals which whom I did not ordinarily 
traverse paths. I stepped outside of my bubble and met girls who were extremely 
extroverted and seemed to be in a constant state of elation. They taught me how to 
spread positivity throughout my daily interactions and taught me to use optimism as a 
strength in facing the hurdles of life. These were qualities I would have never learned 
from a textbook. 
My parents had possessed strong reservations about me joining and feared I would 
meet girls who weren’t motivated in academics. This was false. Many of the girls were 
brilliant and creative in ways my regular friend group wasn’t. All avenues of life met 
there on that team. 
Cheerleading was the rain and sun that helped a small seed like me bloom into a flower. 
It delights me knowing that I gained social skills and made friends I never thought I 
could gain. Cheerleading has changed my perspective on life and joining that family is 
one of my greatest treasures."
74,"Filled with activity around the clock. A place to come home to. 
Loving.

75,"Last summer I participated in molecular biology research at Boston University. 
Surrounded by 39 other high school seniors, I perceived with new clarity how an 
inquisitive, curious mind must interact in an unapologetic manner. Entering lectures 
about the basics of molecular biology, most of us initially thought we knew a great deal 
about biology. I quickly realized my naivete, and once I accepted my own ignorance, I 
settled into a passive absorption mode. The looks on all our faces told the same 
story. Well, all of ours except Kelsey’s. 
Brilliant and inquisitive, Kelsey exhibited no fear raising her hand and boldly asking 
questions. Even during the portions of the lectures when we were simply reviewing 
concepts of biology, she never ceased to question the current topic. The first few times 
she asked questions, I thought she had little background knowledge so she just needed 
clarification. Yet as the first week progressed, I realized that not only did she have the 
background information required for this course but also the grit and determination 
needed for success in research. The levels of her questions stumped our lecturer at 
times and he responded, “I’ll have to get back to you on that one.” 
Often I just wanted to yell, “PUT YOUR HAND DOWN!!!”, as my tolerance for her 
constant inquiry began to erode while sitting through her questions and their 
subsequent answers. Due to her deep and thought-provoking questions, she became 
the class pariah; not necessarily because she was annoying but because of her resolute 
and indefatigable inquisitiveness. She was insatiable in her pursuit of knowledge, like a 
ribosome clinging to the endoplasmic reticulum. 
Yet as the course progressed, I finally began to notice the value of Kelsey’s questions. 
She asked questions of importance, questions researchers must ask themselves 
everyday. Her inquiries were thoughts no one else my age seemed to have. The depth 
and breadth of her ideas fascinated me, especially given that she was only sixteen. 
Kelsey’s questions made me realize the importance of questioning preconceived 
notions. 
Subsequently, I became aware of my own willingness to challenge concepts that were 
accepted and taught as seemingly concrete, and I recognized the danger of blindly 
absorbing information without disputing it. Seeing the scholarly nature of Kelsey’s 
intellectual curiosity, I began to emulate her queries during the final few weeks of the 
program. Not only did I get more out of the lectures, but I also gained the experience 
necessary to question ideas and facts and search for answers, a vital skill in every 
academic realm. 
As a student with an interest in the sciences, I ask questions that may not have an 
obvious answer. As someone who strives for knowledge, I am willing to do research if 
what I am asking has no answer, but I do not simply possess an affinity toward 
knowledge. I wish to create it. Most young people cite coaches, teachers, or other 
adults as influential; however, for me, a peer-modeled approach to learning also has 
merit."
76,"The relationship I cultivated with my school's college center, by simply being inquisitive, 
has been most significant. Over my years in high school the college center became my 2nd 
home, where I learned about extra opportunities and triumphed with help from counselors. 
For instance, with help from my school’s college center I applied and was accepted as an 
LAUSD Superintendent Summer Scholar this past summer. The program selected 15 
juniors out of over 450 applicants to work in one of 15 departments, and I was chosen to 
work for the communications department, which received over 70 applications – making 
me 1 of 70. Interning for LAUSD at their 29 floor high rise was very eye-opening and 
exposed me to working in communications alongside seasoned professionals. The 
opportunity gave me the chance to meet the Superintendent and school board members, 
who are politically in charge of my education. As part of the communications department I 
learned how the district operates a network of over 1,300 schools and saw how the 2nd 
largest school district shares info with stakeholders through universal press releases, 
phone calls, and the district homepage. 
I wrote several articles for the district publication and worked with public information 
officers who taught me the principles of professionalism and how to communicate to over 1 
million people. Recently, I was called from the district to become a part of their Media 
Advisory Council working alongside district heads, representing the students of LAUSD. 
Working for LAUSD furthered my passion to pursue careers in both communication and 
education. I have always had a desire to be a journalist and the internship assured me of 
that. I want to write stories bringing student issues from areas like mine to light. Being 
exposed to the movers and shakers that control education in Los Angeles has heavily 
motivated me to become an educator and at some point become a school board member 
influencing the education students like me receive. 
Support from the college center has spawned opportunities like a life-changing internship 
and set me on course for a future full of opportunity."
77,"I am ""Korean big toes"", ""a water panda in disguise"", and ""Mr. Sweatface"" - these are the 
nicknames I happily accepted over the years. My life was a buoyant bubble, full of 
gratification, funny nicknames, and simple pleasures; but that changed when I was 
confronted with the inhumane conditions of the LGBT centers around my town. 
Stepping into the stone-house building, a few things immediately caught my attention. 
The rooms were small, full of broken furniture, smelled of mold, and had poor lighting; 
moreover, there was no privacy and extremely limited resources. It was obvious that the 
facility didn't have the funds to sustain itself, let alone help anyone trying to assimilate 
back into society. My heart ached as I realized the advantages I had been taking for 
granted; the idealistic mirage of reality I previously held, was now replaced by an 
overwhelming truth: Life isn't fair. Everyone in that facility had been criminalized for their 
sexuality, and I was going to do something about it! 
Over the next few weeks, I brainstormed ideas and eventually decided on creating a 
blog where I would share the stories of anyone who was willing to speak up for change. 
The clickety-clack of my keyboard filled the common rooms of LGBT centers around my 
city. I slowly-but-surely interviewed the residents of these homes, recording stories of 
inequality and discrimination. As I uploaded each story to my blog, I felt a sense of 
accomplishment knowing that I was breaking down barriers and fulfilling my passions. 
Furthermore, reading the comments flooding my inbox, I realized that although the 
LGBT centers in my area still remain underfunded, I had made an impact on individuals 
through my blog and did something for a community I genuinely cared about. It was 
more than I could have ever hoped for. 
In my quest to create change, I forged a new nickname for myself -- ""advocate""; except, 
unlike the titles I was bestowed as a kid, this nickname represented my creativity, 
ingenuity, and passion, and for those reasons, it is more precious than anyone will ever 
know."
78,"Ever since I can remember, the comforting lullabies my mother sang to me planted a 
deep seed in my mind. In my dreams, I began a journey for my identity to discover the 
hidden stories within those songs. Perhaps that's what led me to explore Hindustani 
music. ""Sa-re-ga"" encodes my ancestors' songs just like ""do-re-mi."" With this solfege, I 
began exploring a vocal part of my culture, collecting the keys to my identity. 
Each song I learned further educated me about myths and legends that helped form 
who I am today. 
When I face adversity in male-dominated activities, I remember Sita, who fought 
heroically in revolutionary conflicts hundreds of years ago. This has empowered me to 
believe in my talents and goals, whether I am doing research or organizing a STEM fair 
in my community. The character Arjuna, who became one of the best archers, taught 
me perseverance and a desire to learn from others. When chosen to fly to Denmark to 
play badminton with local clubs, I embraced this experience to play among outstanding 
competitors and to enhance my competitive abilities. As an Asian American, I am 
reminded by the Indian National Anthem that I am an American and an Indian. 
I plan to bring my music and stories with me to college. The keyboard in my Duke dorm 
will ring with strong Hindustani notes. I hope to share with my dorm mates and friends 
the history of those heroes and the strength I gleam from them every day."
79,"Think Purple: Aspiring journalist dreams of being a Wildcat Filed under Admissions, 
Top Stories 
After brochure browsing, website wandering, and campus canvassing what felt like 
hundreds of different schools, it took Daisy Conant exactly 32 seconds on the Northwestern 
University campus to realize she had found the one. 
“Northwestern is undefinable in the best way, an addicting hub of intellectuality, creativity, 
and school spirit - something especially appealing to a football lover,” laughed Conant. “But 
what excites me most about NU is the opportunity to study at the Medill School of 
Journalism.” 
A writer with hopes of becoming a foreign correspondent, Conant has always been drawn 
to people and their stories, especially those completely unfamiliar to herself and her 
experiences. Once learning she could start on day one at Medill acquiring investigative 
journalism experience writing an enterprise story and end on day 600 with a journalism 
residency and international experience already under her belt, she was hooked. 
“Conducting groundbreaking research on the socioeconomic disparities in the CPS system 
for the Medill Justice Project, spending a semester abroad reporting on cultural crisis in 
Greece, interning at the Post - at Medill, my options are boundless,” remarked Conant. “I 
could explore the world of print news writing in-focuses for the Daily Northwestern, 
dabble in magazine editing laying out spreads for North by Northwestern, even try my 
hand at broadcast reporting for WNUR.” 
A journalist at heart, Conant is fascinated with the intersections of other disciplines. As an 
NU student she would be free to engage her passions for international studies and business 
through outside concentrations in addition to investigative journalism, uncovering the 
adventures (and discovering the tenacious Wildcats) that lie between Evanston and the 
shores of Lake Michigan. “My story is just beginning,” said Conant. “And Northwestern is 
the perfect lede.”"
80,"I am a mountain lover, I am a squash grower, and I am a salty dog rag dancer. I am the third 
generation in my family to spend my summers in the valley of the Adirondack mountains, 
unplugged and barefoot nearly every waking moment with the lush earth beneath my feet. 
I spent my days climbing the mountains, planting and harvesting food, and square-dancing 
to the joyful sound of the fiddle. 
I fell in love with the sacred simplicity and generous bounty of nature's gifts. There is a 
reverence for life that you achieve when you create a meal from the meat that you raised 
yourself, vegetables that you pulled from the dirt with your bare hands, and eggs that you 
gathered early that morning. I can feel myself connected to the planet, breathing with the 
earth like we are both parts of the same organism. 
Between my Adirondack summers, I spent weeks living with the Hopi Indian Tribe grinding 
corn between rocks while singing native songs under the blistering Arizona sun. I found 
peace living off only what was around me, enjoying what mother earth had to offer. As one 
of the Hopi proverbs reads, “time isn't used, it's experienced” and how we chose to 
experience it, shapes our lives. 
I learned to love soil and all its nourishing qualities, the joy of falling asleep under the stars 
and celebrating a native culture centuries old. My family’s summer tradition of leaving 
modern technology behind lead me to a life of appreciation and thankfulness without the 
influence of the digital world. Dreaming without distraction liberated me to genuinely 
experience life because just living day to day is not enough, one must learn to appreciate 
everything around them in order to truly live with the world, not just in it."
81,"In 2011, I started at a newly built school spanning sixth to twelfth grade. The school’s 
inception was not the greatest with gang culture and issues plaguing the school and 
nearby community. From this moment I knew wanted to make a change, improving the 
school and local community. 
For example, two years ago a bicyclist was crushed by a container truck across the 
street from my school, several peers of mine and I advocated for a bike lane to get 
installed on the street to protect cyclists from the busy traffic. I worked day and night for 
three weeks using my connection with the city’s public works director to meet with city 
officials and make a change. I looked for solutions and ways to improve my community 
and lead the charge to better our street. When we met with city officials they agreed and 
ultimately approved our bike lane proposal. This civic action started with a group of 
three concerned high school students, in which I helped facilitate the conversations 
resulting into a bike lane project, that will be built the summer of 2018 after I graduate 
high school. Ultimately helping solve an issue in my community. 
Using my influence as part of the Associated Student Body I advocated for a new 
medical academy on my school’s campus to address the growing interest in medicine 
and health careers of many students at my school. While I am not personally interested 
in a health related field, I recognized that many students at my school did and teachers 
agreed. I came in as an intermediary, who because of my position in ASB was also a 
member of my School’s Shared Leadership Council (SLC), through these means I 
motivated other ASB officers to support the academy’s inception and after a grueling 
amount of meetings in which we went through logistics the academy was approved for 
the benefit of students. 
I am a student who will attend a UC pursuing my passions in journalism, education, and 
history; while being an involved student making the campus a better place than when I 
first arrived."
82,"It's an understatement to label me as an English geek; I am that kid who squeals in 
excitement in English class when given a new essay assignment while others may 
groan in exasperation. I understand why some may be a bit anxious when preparing to 
turn in an essay for evaluation; you could bring an essay to two different English 
teachers and receive two different grades on it. This subjectivity is why some folks may 
prefer subjects such as mathematics in which the right answer is not debatable. 
However, its subjectivity is exactly what captivates me. I enjoy reasoning my opinions of 
arguments and the intentions of authors. 
I was really happy when I learned I didn't have to major in Criminal Justice or Political 
Science to be a civil rights lawyer because I want to become a professional author as 
well. So, majoring in English is perfect for me."
83,"“Give me liberty, or give me death!”, I proudly exclaimed, finishing up a speech during 
my first Individual Event competition for Speech and Debate, also known as Forensics 
Workshop. Public speaking was always one of my shortcomings. During countless in-
class presentations, I suffered from stage-fright and anxiety, and my voice always 
turned nervous and silent. I saw Speech and Debate as a solution to this barrier that 
hindered my ability to teach and learn. With excessive practice, I passed the tryout and 
found myself in the zero-period class. All of my teammates, however, joined because 
they loved chattering and arguing. I had the opposite reason: I despised public 
speaking. 
I was definitely one of the least competitive members of the team, probably because I 
didn’t take the tournaments very seriously and mainly worried about being a better 
speaker for the future. Throughout the daily class, I engaged in impromptu competitions, 
speech interpretations, spontaneous arguments, etc... Throughout my two years on the 
team, my communication, reciting, writing, and arguing skills overall improved through 
participation in events such as Impromptu, Original Oratory, Oratorical Interpretation, 
Lincoln Douglas Debate, and Congress. I even achieved a Certificate of Excellence in 
my first competition for Oratorical Interpretation -- where we had to recite a historical or 
current speech -- for Patrick Henry’s “Give Me Liberty, or Give Me Death.” 
I decided to quit Speech and Debate because I felt as if it has completed its purpose. 
After this educational experience, my communications skilled soared, so I could perform 
better in school, especially on essays and presentations. Leaving this activity after two 
years gave me more time to focus on other activities, and apply communications skills 
to them. In fact, I even did better in interviews (which is how I got into the Torrance 
Youth Development Program) and even obtained leadership positions in clubs such as 
Math Club and Science Olympiad Through my two years in Speech and Debate, I 
believe I became a much better thinker, speaker, and leader. Taking advantage of this 
opportunity boosted my self-esteem and overall made high school a better experience."
84,"Just when we think we figured things out, the universe throws us a curveball. So, we 
have to improvise. The universe is funny like that. Sometimes it just has a way of 
making sure we wind up exactly where we belong. 
When I first started playing flute, I probably looked like a pufferfish choking on a clump 
of wasabi, but that didn't matter. Blasting deep breaths into my flute, I blew voraciously 
as I tried to produce a B-flat; but all I could muster was a raspy whistle. 
6 years later, I was filled with pride knowing that I had worked hard enough to be 
selected as the concert soloist for the Youth Orchestra of Bucks County. My moment 
had arrived; I stand center-stage and begin Chaminade's Concertino Op. 107. 
Recognizing the minor scales and arpeggios, my fingers glide through the measures 
with absolute certainty; and with each successive measure, my breathing, tone, and 
articulation seemed to increasingly synchronize. Before long, the piece came to an end. 
Holding the D-natural farmada as long I could, I let the note fade into submission and 
lowered my flute. Taking a bow, I reveled in the magnitude of my hard work. 
As I grew older, it became evident that I would need orthodontics and jaw reduction 
surgeries. With my face full of rubber and metal, I couldn't form a tight enough valve to 
sustain notes. I was officially back to square one. The following months were brutal, I 
had to put away Tchaikovsky and go back to the basics; but my effort was genuine and I 
gradually regained my ability to play. 
Today, I consider playing flute my greatest skill. Not because I can play complex scales 
or win competitions, but, instead, because through the horrors of braces, learning how 
to double-tongue, and impossibly fast measures, I never gave up. Playing flute had 
crafted in me the relentless determination which I've exhibited over the past 8 years. I 
may not know what curveballs life will pitch to me next, but I have confidence knowing I 
will persevere regardless of the circumstances."
85,"Although many would say that hardships are the greatest hindrance on a person, my 
hardships are my greatest assets. The hardships I have overcome are what push and 
drive me forward. If I had not gone through the failures of my 7th grade year I may have 
been satisfied as a B or C student. It is easy for us to use our hardships as excuses for 
not doing work, however, this is a mistake that many people make. 
Through my struggles and failure, I have realized an important truth: I am not special. 
The world will continue to go on and expect me to contribute no matter what I have 
gone through. Everyone endures some type of obstacle in their life; what makes people 
different is how they handle them. Some sit around and cry ""boo-hoo"" waiting for people 
to feel sorry for them. Others actually take action to improve their situation. 
Through hard work, I have been able to outperform my peers, yet I know there is still 
room for improvement. The thought of actual geniuses in top universities excited me; I 
long to learn from them and eventually surpass them, or perhaps enter a never ending 
race for knowledge with them. I used to live an hour away from school. I would have to 
wake up and be dropped off at a donut shop at 4 in the morning and then walk to school 
at 6:30 am. After school, I would have to walk to the public library and stay for as long 
as it was open then wait outside and get picked up around 9:30 pm. I am reluctant to 
retell this story; not because I am ashamed, but because it is not important. It doesn't 
matter what hardships I have endured, they do not determine who I am. What matters is 
what I have done."
86,"While reading Tolkien's The Silmarillion, I was struck by the elegance of the Elvish 
script he included. Upon further research, I discovered that he had created an entire 
language – Quenya – to accompany the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The idea that a 
language could be crafted and cultivated like a piece of art was both illuminating and 
inspiring to me. I had heard of Esperanto previously, but I believe Tolkien wasn’t trying 
to change the world with his creation. His goal was simply to create a language for the 
pleasure of it, and to enrich his storytelling and worldbuilding. 
The revelation that language could be more than just a tool for communication triggered 
a love for linguistics that persists to this day. I voraciously tore through reference 
grammars and college textbooks alike, including An Introduction to Historical 
Linguistics by Lyle Campbell. 
I even tried to emulate Tolkien and create a language of my own. Whether at school 
taking classes in Spanish, French, Italian, Latin, and Ancient Greek, or at home 
studying the phonology of Brazilian Portuguese on my own, languages excited and 
motivated me to learn more. I was awarded the Arthur Beatty award for outstanding 
linguist in the year as a result of my dedication to the language program at school. 
Watching Game of Thrones reintroduced me to conlanging in the form of Dothraki and 
rekindled my interest, prompting me to write my IB extended essay on the historical 
etymology of Spanish. It was a challenging project, but I loved every minute of my 
research. While my friends were lamenting their boredom at poring over endless 
journals on topics they didn’t enjoy, I was studying a subject for which I am truly 
passionate. I hope to continue my study of language in university, and one of my goals 
in life is to be trilingual. I have no doubt that languages will continue to inspire me 
throughout life, and I hope to be able to share some of this passion with others along 
the way."
87,"I felt the cold sheets beneath me and the beeping sounds of a monitor next to my bed, 
my chest moving up and down and my body sinking into the mattress. I opened my 
eyes and was greeted with a plastic surgeon holding the cyst that was once in the 
corner of my eye. Medicine, I decided, was my destiny. 
Flash forward to 8th grade, the year I decided to read 100 books. Emerson, John 
Green, Ernest Cline--you name the author, I read them. I became instantly inspired to 
learn to write like the wonderful authors I had read. So, writing, I decided (maybe), was 
my destiny. 
Wait--or was it medicine? Well, perhaps it can be both. 
The thing I find most striking about Northwestern is its emphasis on the word “AND.” 
Northwestern students can love computer science AND music theory, poetry AND Latin 
History, journalism AND business--I can love science AND English. At Northwestern, 
my interests would not be hindered by strict and unwavering guidelines. Rather, they 
could be effortlessly streamlined and integrated into one another. I could go from 
PSYCH 361--Brain Damage and the Mind to ENG 206 - Reading and Writing Poetry to 
Carol Clayberger’s Lab to continue my extensive research on T-lymphocytes, similar to 
that I conducted at UPMC. I would be learning each level of the human psyche, 
communicating my thoughts through writing, and putting them into action through my 
research. 
At Northwestern, I plan to take advantage of the various resources that would enable 
me to pursue my passions, find new ones, and combine them into one, pulling from both 
sides of my brain. I know that I am right for Northwestern and Northwestern is right for 
me because we have a mutual understanding of what education should look like--
emphasis on “AND,” not “OR.”"
88,"Touring a college is not always enough to get a sense of what the college is like. But, I 
had the unique opportunity to meet with Professor Dennis Rasmussen and discuss 
Political Science at Tufts. He talked to me about the unique opportunities which Tufts 
students have, from the fantastic study abroad opportunities to a senior thesis which 
lets you dip your feet into research before moving onto higher education. The 
combination of Professor Rasmussen’s thoughtfulness and the school’s academic 
prowess proved to me that Tufts is the place to be."
89,"There is something intimate, almost profound, in mirroring the movements of about 14 
people around you. 
From paralleling the idiosyncrasies of a vibraphone player’s smile to the nuances of a 
marimba player’s wrist movements, it is difficult to achieve total nonverbal 
communication in a band’s front ensemble. The result, however, is an infinitely 
rewarding one; the visual mosaic we design — whether inside the confines of a 
gymnasium floor or on an expansive stretch of turf on a football field — is akin to the 
aural one we create as well. This tapestry, while ostensibly uniform, is woven with the 
gradations of every player’s physical form, their quirks quickly adopted by the whole 
ensemble. 
Indeed, pantomiming and performing become one in the same in the stationary 
percussive marching arts. This mimicry demands a sacred conviction that every player 
will commit to maintaining the mosaic that we’ve worked so hard to build. The tense 
moment when each player waves his or her mallets above the board permits no 
hesitation; there is no room to confirm the camaraderie between players before striking 
the keys. We are forced to trust that everything will fall into place, and the tapestry will 
unfold as it should to captivate our audience. 
I’ve learned a lot from playing mallet percussion across the ensembles offered at my 
school, but the most important thing I’ve learned is to relax, and allow the hours me and 
my peers have put into rehearsal take their course. I am a notoriously anxious person, 
obsessed with precision and perfection. Performing is anything but precise; it’s fluid and 
expressive. When the drum major counts off, I cannot worry about my stance behind the 
board, or if how much torque I am applying to the first stroke is the same as the person 
next to me. I must be unapologetically confident. 
The faith that I’ve cultivated in my peers in creating this musical tapestry has translated 
to an increased faith in myself and my own abilities. No longer am I afraid to explore 
new talents, or take intellectual excursions into fields unbeknownst to me. I am free to 
teach myself anything, from the entirety of Claude Debussy's works on piano to the 
John Cena theme song on recorder. Indeed, contributing to something greater than 
myself has fundamentally changed who I am for the better."
90,"Walking into school on the first day of my senior year, the excitement about college was 
evident as I passed through the halls. While many students discussed the local options, 
the one name I heard that really drew me in was Indiana. Unaware of the tremendous 
opportunities that would be within my reach as a student there, I began to learn more 
information through both individual research and from discussion with alumni. This was 
how I knew Bloomington was the place for me. 
Always interested in business, the characteristics of the Kelley School run parallel to 
those that I value in numerous ways. First, because I have taken Chinese for most of 
my time as a student, international experience is vital to me. While classroom learning is 
no doubt helpful, continuing my education of the language within the culture will teach 
me more meaning to the words that I am speaking. Tying in with business, it also will 
give me leadership experience dealing with planning and collaboration around the 
globe. 
The collaborative community is another aspect of Indiana that I truly appreciate. Dating 
back to the first group activities I worked on at school, I have always appreciated the 
helpfulness in working with my peers rather than against them. Working with others to 
solve problems is not only how I have accomplished so many of my goals, but also how 
I have made some of my closest friends. Additionally, I will utilize this emphasis of 
collaboration with my professors at the Kelley School as a way to enrich what I have 
learned in their classrooms. 
While in collaboration with my classmates, friends, and professors, I will begin 
connecting myself with the future alumna- and eventually become one down the road. 
Since the Kelley School has the largest alumni population of any other business school, 
the community I am entering into is sure to be influential in the future. This opportunity 
to enter this prestigious group will open up doors and give me access to some of the top 
people in business today. 
I cannot wait to be a part of the community within the Kelley School: for not just the next 
four years of my life, but the rest of my life."
91,"One month into AP Physics C Mr. Shapiro's cancer came out of remission. With no 
teacher for the rest of the semester, I offered to give a few lectures. The first try was a 
huge success and I was hooked on teaching. 
Following my newfound addiction, I started Lowell Physics Club (LPC). Our first lecture 
attracted 50 students, with 40 returning the next week! 
A victim of grandeur, I designed an environment more than a club. It had to be 
innovative, attractive, and have a tangible payoff. We tutor students in physics, connect 
those looking for fun projects, prepare students for the F=ma Olympiad, and sometimes 
I give lectures which expand rather than repeat. This year two students qualified. 
Mr. Shapiro returned this semester and continued teaching. I can now relax in the back 
of the room listening to his engaging lectures, occasionally giving one of my own."
92,"The bus took ten minutes to get home this time, not the usual thirty. This wasn’t my 
home, but it would essentially become just that. 
The Morristown Neighborhood House is a center that provides a free and safe after-
school environment for local children. While I had previously participated in various 
service programs, something was different about NH. Whether it was teaching long 
division or playing a game of chess, the bonds I established with the kids were real, 
human connections. 
It was a privilege to be appointed service coordinator at the end of my junior year. But, I 
wanted to further immerse myself into “the Nabe.” While there were various summer 
options, I felt that there couldn’t be a better choice than signing up to be a camp 
counselor at the Nabe. 
The kids became family; through sarcophagus art projects, writing practice, Xbox 
tournaments, implicit bias discussions, and trips to the park, they became the little 
siblings I never had. When I brought in ice cream for all of them on my birthday, I was 
showered with hugs. No foreign exchange trip could outdo that. 
I am a member of many communities based on my geography, ethnicity, interests, and 
talents, but the most meaningful community is the one that I never thought I would be a 
part of. Bryan, Genesis, Justin, John, Christian, Jason, Jazarah, Jaeden, Steven, 
Angelique, Isabella... and Yajur. 
On that first bus ride to the Nabe, I never saw it coming."
93,"When I first joined the fire station as an EMT candidate, it was under the naive 
assumption that every call would be exciting and life-threatening, based on my 
extensive Grey’s Anatomy background. The truth couldn’t be further from my 
expectations. Many of our patients have non-specific, generalized symptoms that aren’t 
life-threatening, such as “I’m a diabetic and I just had two pints of ice cream to celebrate 
the Fourth of July.” We often take care of people who don’t want to take care of 
themselves. So why do we do it? Sometimes it’s a difficult question to answer, 
especially after a long shift. But in most cases, I hold the firm belief that what we do 
makes a difference. We clean up vomit, yes, we’re verbally assaulted, sure, but our 
interventions, both medical and otherwise, give people a second chance. Be it bringing 
patients back from cardiac arrest, reporting domestic violence to the police, or simply 
providing emotional support to a suicidal person, we’re endowed with the opportunity to 
intervene at the most critical points in a patient’s life. It is a privilege unique to first 
responders, and one that I cherish on every call I run, from the mundane to the life-
threatening. 
My initial idealism has been molded and tempered to accommodate hard reality. It 
persists in a more flexible form, has adapted to context. But it persists. It compels me to 
continue to help others with the skills I know, drives me to master ones I don’t. The 
University of Pittsburgh has many excellent opportunities for learning through helping 
others, including Pitt Make a Difference Day(s), affiliation with JumpStart Pittsburgh, 
and its overall commitment to serving the public. Should I be accepted, I plan on taking 
full advantage of all Pitt has to offer, and hope to continue practicing and developing my 
skills as an emergency medical responder and as a member of the community."
94,"For my thirteenth birthday, I received a book. This was a common occurrence in my 
household- from a young age, my birthdays have consisted of carefully-wrapped books, 
ranging from popular works, like Harry Potter, to more obscure yet poignant reads such 
as Flowers for Algernon. 
However, I could not conceal the disappointment on my face when I opened this year’s 
book: What the World Eats, a nonfiction work about the dietary and cultural differences 
between countries around the world. Little did I know that i would spend the rest of the 
day learning what one week’s worth of food amounted to in Bhutan, Chad, Egypt, and 
twenty others. As I flipped through the book, I saw pictures of typical families in different 
countries standing next to their groceries from the past week. What startled me was the 
lack of what I considered an essential ingredient: meat. 
Throughout my life, every meal I ate had been centered around meat, but seeing the 
colorful vegetarian options created in countries like Bhutan, where meat is only available 
once or twice a month, challenged my conformity to typical American culture. I realized 
that just as culture is reflected in religion and traditions, it is also reflected in food, and 
there is not a singular “right” way to eat. 
Realizing a vegetarian lifestyle is possible and even common in other cultures prompted 
me to research the benefits of a vegetarian diet and to eventually give up meat for good 
after realizing the profound ecological and humanitarian benefits vegetarianism has on 
society. What the World Eats changed my dietary lifestyle, but also challenged me to try 
new things, explore unknown possibilities, and keep my mind open to other cultures."
95,"As I prepared for my freshman year of high school, I was terrified I would never find my 
place at Grosse Pointe South. But when I started my first marching band camp a month 
before school began, I found the friends that would form my tightest-knit community for 
the next four years. 
No matter how busy my schedule has become, the six hours I spend each week at marching 
band have remained a constant throughout high school. These friends have been the most 
unfailingly kind people I have met at South, and have provided me a place where I feel 
confident presenting myself authentically to the people around me. 
As a section leader this year, I have gained experience as a supporter and motivator. My 
goal has been to help the underclassmen find the same community in marching band that I 
did. 
This role has taught me a lot about collaboration. My fellow section leaders and I have 
shared responsibility for the quality of every performance we give and held meetings to 
discuss ways to improve rehearsal productivity. It has been incredible to see our hard work 
result in such enjoyable performances for our school and surrounding community. 
The Grosse Pointe South Marching Band has become my second family throughout the last 
four years. I am incredibly grateful for the friends I will miss so much next year, and for the 
opportunity to provide underclassmen with the same kind and accepting environment that 
I was welcomed into four years ago."
96,"Growing up, I always pictured myself as a great teacher as an adult. With the second 
best secondary education program in the country and an emphasis on the liberal arts 
and undergraduate education, I am confident that U-M will shape me into the great 
educator I’ve dreamed of becoming since I was a kid. 
Hallmarks of a liberal arts education include teamwork, problem-solving, clear writing, 
and effective communication. These are also skills that any exceptional teacher needs. 
U-M offers an unparalleled curriculum that prepares students to successfully run 
classrooms and obtain Provisional Teacher Certifications upon graduation, exposing 
students to diverse classes and people in Ann Arbor, and providing them with an 
invaluable liberal arts education along the way. 
Being an effective teacher means connecting with and stimulating all students at its 
core. The liberal arts foundation I will receive in the College of Literature, Sciences, and 
the Arts (LSA), married with the experiential education and training the School of 
Education (SoE) will provide, will mold me into that great teacher—a mentor and role 
model for any student, regardless of creed—I’ve always aspired to become. 
The Teacher Education Preferred Admission (TEPA) for incoming freshmen piqued my 
interest because the program is the crossroad between the liberal arts and teacher 
education; two components I was looking for in a college. TEPA will allow me to build a 
strong liberal arts base in LSA my first two years on campus before entering SoE, while 
also gaining beneficial experiences in the education field early on. 
The education-oriented programs WE READ and Students Empowering Education 
specifically appealed to me because they will bridge my liberal arts education with my 
anticipated career as a high school English teacher. Similarly, my Spanish classes will 
have a practical application in the Ann Arbor Language Partnership, a program that 
immediately interested me as a potential Spanish minor. 
During my first two years as a pre-admit, I'll be supported by my TEPA peers and staff, 
specifically from my SoE personal adviser. TEPA will take the large campus and make it 
feel smaller, allowing me to form organic connections with like-minded people and 
groups that can cultivate my interest in education before entering SoE junior year. 
I need a meaningful education to be a meaningful educator. Truthfully, I could go to 
almost any college to become a teacher, but only schools that synthesize in- and out-of-
classroom learning like SoE produce great ones. U-M ranking sixth in the country for 
undergraduate teaching bolstered my interest in the university and confirmed what I 
already knew: I will receive an education in LSA and SoE that will change who I am as a 
person and not just a student, and prepare me to provide the same for others as a 
teacher. 
The great educator I’ve always envisioned myself becoming is one that can inspire 
without bounds. From my time as a student, I’ve come to realize that a truly influential 
teacher can work with students who have little in common with themselves and still be 
impactful. LSA's purposeful and broad curriculum, paired with SoE's hands-on courses 
and fieldwork, and the additional opportunities available through TEPA, will shape me 
into that life-changing teacher, for any student who walks through my classroom door."
97,"I remove the latex gloves from my hands. I oscillate between looking at the rats 
enclosed in the acoustic startle chambers to my right, and my team project advisor to 
my left. A silver lab table, cluttered with syringes, vials, and countless notes, separates 
me and him. A lab rat’s cage sits at the center like a cornucopia. I begin to sit on a cold 
lab stool, and upon confirming that the Startle Reflex software is indeed running, I settle 
into my seat. Though the atmosphere smells faintly of urine, I am comfortable. 
These lazy afternoons collecting data defined my experience at the Governor’s School 
in the Sciences. Our team would spend hours with the acoustic startle chambers, 
startling rats in the presence of anxiogenic pheromones from other rodent urine in order 
to evaluate their altered behavioral responses — freezing, excessive grooming, 
urination, that sort of thing. Turns out, scaring rats enough to pee their pants takes a 
long time. 
My team project advisor, Zach, made these long hours, not only bearable, but pivotal in 
my understanding of the applied sciences. Zach was the youngest counselor at GSS 
and was definitely the easiest to talk to. He would always entertain me and my peers 
with tales of his college club’s calls for divestment in the fossil fuel industry. He relayed 
to us an inspiring tale: one day, while completing some organic chemistry assignment, 
Zach felt the commanding urge to start a protest. Against the backdrop of the divisive 
presidential election of 2016, Zach felt increasingly frustrated by a general feeling of 
listlessness amid a rapidly transforming world. He eventually found environmental 
activism, drawing on his scientific background, as a vehicle to make tangible change in 
the global landscape. And while Zach’s angsty musings were easy to tease, always 
ornamented with quintessential frat-boy idiosyncrasies, like the overuse of the words 
“bro” and “yo,” they forced me to consider my own passions in the context of scientific 
inquiry. Zach, motivated by the pregnant intersection between environmental science 
and civic engagement, oriented my own career goals in a very profound way. 
Prior to GSS, I had always found myself trying to mediate between my interests in 
public policy and science, from obsessively reading about America’s diplomatic relations 
to Middle East, to madly teaching myself about the neuroscientific underpinnings of 
behavior. Zach’s endeavors, his involvement in activism while studying 
science, revealed an entire sphere between two worlds where my own passions in both 
could finally coincide. The fruitful conversations I had with Zach demanded that I 
consider the pragmatic applications of the research we were doing, engaging with the 
real world in the same manner he had. 
Researching chemical signaling in rodents was an exploration of the social transmission 
of fear in humans — a study with numerous political applications, especially in today’s 
age of demagogic political rhetoric. Indeed, a rat gaining awareness of a fearful situation 
is analogous to a human’s awareness of a fearful situation; hysteria in large groups has 
often lent to social chaos, falling victim to the same conspecific negotiations as in our 
rodent study. Application of our study in a political context made me realize that my 
interests are interwoven, though kaleidoscopic. 
At GSS, whether it be in the lectures I listened to or the labs I did, my professors 
borrowed ideas from all fields alike; political implications arising in neuroscientific 
research, cultural anthropology in human evolution — even philosophical inquiries 
appeared in courses on special relativity. I loved every academic excursion onto these 
intellectual, peripheral avenues, as they always contextualized science in a broader 
sense. This interdisciplinary way of thinking is where I have found my passions to 
reside, inspired by Zach’s ruminations on activism amid a place of such intellectual 
vitality; I know this is, not only where complex solutions to the world's problems reside, 
but where my future does too."
98,"The saying ""you can be your own worst enemy"" was the embodiment of the time I hit 
lowest point. Finishing my 22-hour days, I expected to lay down in bed close my eyes, 
and smile: thinking about all my accomplishments. Instead, I was sleep deprived, rapidly 
losing and gaining weight, and unhappy. 
As a result, I stopped being able to focus and my grades began to fall. I lost motivation 
and the only reason I did anything was because of my obsession with completion. In 
this vulnerable state, I would tell myself I was useless and shy away from taking 
opportunities. I started to question if could get out of the hole I dug. Ironically, I have 
always been an optimist. I thought about the many things I wanted to do and I wouldn't 
be able to do any of them from a hospital bed. 
Seeing the bright light ahead of me, I moved forward to a journey of self-improvement. 
First, I isolated myself from things that were affecting my happiness through finding a 
place where I could peacefully think about why I was enduring so much pain, regularly 
eat, and get some sleep. When I came back from my retreat, I continued my routine 
which improved my health and performance in school. The greatest outcome was my 
realization that I was compensating for my lack of self-esteem, I've been trying to get 
validation from my parents and peers by trying to be perfect, but when my friends left 
me and my parents didn't notice my efforts I overworked myself. 
It was hard to stop searching for approval, yet the support of close friends and 
acknowledging that I'm doing everything I'm capable of, revealed to me what its like to 
love yourself. From then on, I determined my self worth, no one else. Now that I found 
my own drive and am confident, I don't have to beg for friends. struggle to maintain 
grades, skip meals, or lose sleep. Presently, I can say I am no longer my worst enemy: 
we're like friends that get closer every day."
99,"The cross-curricular focus and freedom of study at Tufts would allow me to pursue an 
interdisciplinary major and draw together my love for Spanish, Portuguese, Linguistics, 
and the natural sciences. This unique ability to design my own major by combining 
elements from a variety of academic fields definitely excites me. To support this, I intend 
to participate in the study abroad program in Chile or a civic semester in Urubamba, 
Peru that will allow me to practice my language skills while also benefitting the local 
community and gaining an invaluable cultural understanding through intimate homestay 
experience. Other than the academics, the vibrant community at Tufts also attracts me, 
with the warm and compassionate students acting as flattering adverts for the school. 
One student I spoke with described the average Jumbo as “goofy and loving” which I 
feel accurately matches my own character and outlook."
100,"Seconds after our teacher announced our project groups I heard the familiar, pitchy 
voice of the most irritating person in the class yell my name. Just like my worst 
nightmare, I had been put in a group to work with Eva; the annoying girl who had a 
weird obsession with horses. At that moment, I knew that it was going to be the longest 
project of my life. 
Eva was extremely difficult to work with; she would always interrupt me, stubbornly 
stuck to what she wanted, and did not listen to a thing I said. Two weeks of tension and 
no progress flew by until one day during class, Eva went on another ramble about her 
horses. 
Although I wasn't ready to hear her talk about horses again, I let her continue. What 
was another rant about horses turned into a conversation about the mental disorders 
Eva faced and how she relied on horse riding as therapy. After that conversation, our 
progress took a complete 180. I was eager to learn more, and we finished the project 
with more purpose and meaning. My perspective changed entirely. 
I was moved by Eva’s passion for horse riding and encouraged her to start a club on 
campus where she could share her passion with others. Beyond this project, I helped 
Eva defend her riding center during city council meetings because it was on the verge of 
being shut down. In exchange, working with Eva taught me how to be more open-
minded, more patient, more understanding; values of which I personally lacked my 
entire life. I began to cooperate with people with a more accepting and considerate 
mentality, understanding that people work in different ways. 
I’m glad I chose to work through the project with Eva because I grew as a leader in a 
way that I would have never expected. I know I could have easily done the project by 
myself, but instead, I worked through our disagreements and bickering. Sharing this 
experience with Eva unearthed my ability to lead using patience and understanding, 
which are now essential assets to my leadership capabilities."
101,"Why Northwestern? Because this introduction was so difficult to write; because I cannot 
possibly summarize these reasons in one introductory sentence. Simply put, my 
interests span across a wide range, and Northwestern has a place for them all. 
As an enthusiastic programmer and advocate for positive minority representation in the 
media, I hope to combine both these interests and conduct research on the influence of 
media on society. To my delight as a prospective communications major, the School of 
Communication's research labs showcase project topics ranging from the depiction of 
STEM in media to improving digital communication. I look forward to taking advantage 
of the high-quality research, internship and even career opportunities offered to explore 
my ideas. 
My multiple passions keep me creative and energetic, and I plan to continue pursuing 
them at Northwestern. With years of editing and writing experience for school 
publications under my belt, for instance, I hope to join the staff of Helicon and North by 
Northwestern. Last but not least is the constant school spirit and sense of inclusion 
present within campus. During my campus tour, each tour guide seemed genuinely 
excited to introduce prospective students to the school. As my particular tour guide 
described the quarter system and tradition of guarding and painting the rock with 
passion in her eyes, I knew that only at Northwestern could I find students as 
enthusiastic about the school itself as they are about their majors. I also spotted many 
students of color while visiting; as an Asian woman, Northwestern's focus on 
diversifying reassures me that not only will I not be judged for my background, but that I 
will get to meet students of all ethnicities and cultures. 
College is a time of self-discovery, and I firmly believe I can see my dreams become 
reality at Northwestern."
102,"Originally I saw volunteer work as a nuisance. I felt that it was an unnecessary 
""requirement"" for college. I felt that someone decided to do volunteer work while in high 
school and now it has become the norm and is essentially required for college. Once I 
began to get involved, however, I found a true appreciation for the work I was doing. 
I loved helping people and, as always, wanted to challenge myself. I worked at the 
Bellflower Volunteer center and tutored kids every day available, as well as helping out 
with large special events put on by the city. I then joined Key Club and made it my 
mission to attend every single event no matter what; even going to the lengths to walk 
for 4 hours starting at 5 in the morning (it was still dark outside) for a 2-hour beach clean 
up. I then became Service Event Coordinator and also made it my mission to have an 
event every week, while attending all of them, while still working at the Volunteer 
Center. I also started a tutoring program in math at my school as I really enjoy helping 
my peers academically. 
It always warmed my heart to see fellow ninjas( our division mascot) at events I had 
planned, friends and neighbors at Bellflower events, and CSF members at tutoring.I am 
always willing to help people with anything. If someone needs my help I will stop 
whatever I am doing to help in any way that I can. Lending a helping hand is an 
important part of our society; however, a helping hand cannot do anything if the other 
hand does not reach for it as well. We need to be able to help ourselves first before 
others can help us. I tried to create a community where I could help people, but also 
people could help themselves so that there is no reason for anyone to not be able to 
achieve their goals and aspirations."
103,"This was the night. Clenching my fists, I called my dad over. Maybe it was the 
adrenaline coursing through my veins or maybe just suspense, but time seemed to 
freeze as anxiety washed over my consciousness. A million doubts flooded my mind as 
I dreaded what would come next. The pitter-patter of his feet hitting the tile floor brought 
me back to reality. My dad had always loved and supported me, I just had to trust that 
things would be alright. 
In a quivering voice, my hands shaking, I explained to my dad that I was gay. After a 
brief moment of silence, my dad said ten words that completely changed my life: ""I 
raised you completely wrong, get out of my house"". I was devastated, but I wasn't 
surprised. This was the same person physically forced pork down my throat when I told 
him I wanted to become a vegetarian; who would hit me and my mom if either of us 
voiced dissenting opinions; and the same person who would come home drunk and 
threaten to kill us. With tears running down my cheeks, I packed my belongings and 
drove my 98' Nissan Pathfinder away from my home. From that night on I learned to be 
brave, to follow my dreams, and to fight for what I believe in. 
The next few years were tough. In my community, being gay was unacceptable and 
embracing my identity meant enduring the consequences. I will never forget being 
dragged into a storage room and choked or hiding the bruises I got from being pelted by 
textbooks. But looking back, I realize that the lessons I learned drove me towards 
success. They inspired me to be relentless and graduate early, to surpass expectations 
by doing college-credit classes, and remain strong in the face of oppression and 
adversity. Moving forward, as I look to broaden my education horizons, I know that I 
have the emotional vitality to success wherever I go. So I want to dedicate this essay to 
my dad and to everyone who made me strong, thank you."
104,"One extra hour is thirty minutes extra of daylight. 
The US has 28 GW of installed solar capacity. With the extra daylight, there will be a 4% 
increase in national capacity, an entire GW added. This small increase alone powers 
700,000 homes. I’m spending the time investing in photovoltaics!"
105,"The judge called “the prosecution may begin to question the defendant.” I shuddered 
quietly to myself as I smoothed my skirt and rose slowly from the chair. As I began to 
speak, I gained my confidence. My statement rolled off my tongue, as I projected my 
voice throughout the courtroom. “Would you please provide a rendition of events during 
this incident?” I asked. But, the testimony given was not in compliance with the pre-
court interview notes from the previous weeks. This defendant was sent to Ontario 
County Youth Court for consuming acid in school. I continued to question cautiously, but 
finally caught the defendant in a blatant lie. I calmly stated, “You are under oath and by 
lying, you are committing a federal offense of perjury. I would please ask you to tell the 
whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so the jury can reach an appropriate sentence.” I 
could see the defendant squirm during this confrontation. But, I was holding the upper 
hand, and lying could not undermine my self-assurance. The case progressed with a 
sense of caution, for the power of prosecution can dampen the mood. 
I have always been a searcher; for new opportunities, new friends, and a true passion. I 
have taken dance classes for fifteen years because I enjoy the creativity of movement, 
exercise, and my friendships with other dancers. But, dance is not my calling in life or 
deepest passion. I have taken tennis, golf, skiing, snowboarding, ice skating, sailing, 
sailboarding, scuba diving, and even sewing lessons. But these are also merely hobbies 
or interests. Freshman year, after fourteen years of searching, I finally discovered my 
true passion and calling in life: a career in law. 
I live on a dirt road and attend a small, rural school. There is not a single traffic light in 
the entire school district. But, these factors of seclusion have never hindered my 
appetite for exploration. One day, I saw a poster hanging in the atrium of my school 
about an information night regarding Ontario County Youth Court. On a whim, I decided 
to attend. I have always been an advocate for trying new activities, or else passions can 
never be unleashed and discovered. Without leaving one’s comfort zone and 
broadening one’s horizons, we can never grow as people. That evening, I sat in a room 
with fifteen other strangers and learned about restorative justice principles and careers 
in law. I was hooked. At that moment, I realized this my calling. 
After completing a 20-hour training process, being inducted as a full member of youth 
court, and religiously attending youth court cases each month, my thirst was still 
unquenched. Therefore, I became involved in court evaluating. Local court officials are 
assessed by volunteers to ensure they are fulfilling their duties to the 
community. Watching judges mandate reprimands for speeding tickets might be dull for 
some, but I find it fascinating. The legal system has such a vast array of powers and 
professions. I have continued to expand my knowledge by attending local, district, and 
circuit courts, along with touring a jail. 
While I was first motivated to join Ontario County Youth Court for the sake of self-
exploration and serving my community, I discovered my passion for law. By interacting 
with a vast array of youth offenders, I have had the opportunity to see the world others 
live in. Now, I have the ability to understand other people’s circumstances and social 
pressures. Most importantly, I have fully encompassed the value of prioritizing the 
common good above individual success."
106,"Thanksgiving is a special time for many in America. It is a celebration of American 
traditions. Growing up, with parents from Bangladesh, we never celebrated 
Thanksgiving – my parents always told me it was an American holiday, and we weren’t 
Americans. Now, we do celebrate Thanksgiving, albeit different from the traditional 
American holiday that most celebrate. 
The cuisine we eat is unique to us – the turkey has spices such as turmeric, giving it a 
hint of the perceptible Bengali flavor. The mashed potatoes in our house aren’t topped 
with gravy – they are topped with curry. There are slight nuances to everything we have 
at the dinner table that combines the essence and cultures of the traditional American 
style with our own Bengali culture. 
I believe that these meals, and our Thanksgiving, describes me personally. The 
combination of the American society in which I live and Bengali household I reside have 
a strong influence in my whole being. This clash of cultures blended together for me is 
something I would in turn contribute to the UNC community. 
I also believe that my background gives me a unique perspective on social justice, 
which allows me to contribute to conversations that others might struggle to contribute 
to. Because of our Thanksgiving and how it shapes me, I will carry that with me to 
college where it will provide a model for myself and my peers at UNC."
107,"When I attended a Notre Dame information session, the admission representative, 
Zach, told us wonderful stories about campus life. One thing that especially stuck out to 
me was how diverse Notre Dame is. It was intriguing to think that I could sit down at a 
lunch table and there would be someone there from Hong Kong, Germany, and Korea. 
This nurtures my love of cultures different from my own. Also, I’ve spent my whole life in 
Kansas City, which is roughly 8 hours away from Indiana. 
The idea of leaving everything that I’ve grown so familiar with frightens me. A family 
friend who attends Notre Dame says that you form a close bond with the people in your 
dorm, but it extends beyond that because it’s like everyone at Notre Dame is family. 
Even the Alumni stay involved long after they’ve graduated. People are proud to have 
graduated from Notre Dame, leading me to believe that when you attend Notre Dame, 
you become a family for life. Notre Dame has a history and legacy of greatness, and I 
would love to be a part of a school that changes lives like that."
108,"Life can be an overwhelming obstacle course, but my ability to get over any bump with a 
smile on my face has been my greatest strength. Maintaining an optimistic outlook has 
introduced me to new opportunities, made me a better leader, and helped me get 
through everyday life. Although my determination to get back up was built by a couple 
scrapes and falls. I learned about the impact of a positive attitude on others through my 
experience on the tennis team. 
The motivation and bond my team had because of the encouragement and support from 
our captains has influenced my approach to interacting with others. For instance, while 
working with my peers, I always praise them for the effort that they put in and patiently 
help them. When applying this to class projects and theater productions, I saw an 
improvement on our performance and our accomplishments felt more satisfying and 
meaningful. My positive attitude is also influential during my job at a convalescent 
home. As an activities assistant, my objective is to get residents to participate in 
activities and to make them fun. 
At times, it’s difficult to convince residents that a macaroni necklace is worth getting out 
of bed for, but I am always that friendly face that cheers them on and picks them up. 
Knowing that my happiness is brightening someone else's day is extremely valuable 
and is the fuel to my enthusiasm. 
Preserving my optimism is not always easy; however, my excitement for the future 
retains my drive to overcome any challenge. Every opportunity given to me is taken 
advantage of, and if something doesn't go as planned. I am confident another door will 
open. Even though I enjoy focusing on the bright side of life, I'm aware that some 
people feel like they cant overcome their challenges alone. I recognized that I can be a 
hand to help people up, someone to believe in them, and a friend to conquer obstacles 
with. Using this positive influence is the very reason why I am looking forward to a 
career in psychology."
109,"A defining factor of my interests and character is membership to Ontario County Youth 
Court. Not only have I enjoyed the career exploration, new opportunities, and service 
aspects of the program, but also the people within it. Youth court provides as alternative 
path legal path for youth offenders. But also serves the community of members who 
conduct the trials. This has allowed me to gain an understanding of other people’s 
situations and circumstances. 
After four years of dedicated membership, I have assumed leadership positions within the 
program. This includes acting as lead prosecutor, along with the elected chair of the 
Ontario County Youth Court Steering Committee. As chair, I have planned successful 
member outreach events such as a Halloween party and a career exploration event. By 
acting as a mentor and providing guidance towards my fellow members, I have encouraged 
others to develop a passion for youth court and law. Without this community, I would have 
never discovered my true passion for law, or broadened my understanding of others."
110,"The first time music ever spoke to me was when I first listened to Bridge Over Troubled 
Water. Lyrics such as “a man just hears what he wants to hear and disregards the rest,” 
made me fall in love with the album, as it made me reflect more upon society’s values, 
and prompted me to question my own. There are more metaphorical lyrics such as “Like 
a bridge over troubled water, I will lay me down”. This resonated with me, since as 
someone who has dealt with an alcoholic mother, I sometimes felt I would never get 
across that water. But Simon and Garfunkel taught me to build a bridge and cross over 
it into better times, and so I did."
111,"Throughout my time at school, I have tried to share my passions and interests with 
others in various ways. 
With the help of a friend, I reinvigorated and reinvented the school linguistics society, 
transforming it from a dull discussion of past exam questions to a seminar-style session 
where I have presented and analysed various interesting aspects of language. We have 
covered topics ranging from phonetics to historical sound change, and it has attracted a 
loyal troop of linguists who relish the weekly meetings almost as much as I do. 
I have also channelled my passion for teaching into volunteering as a Spanish teacher 
at another local elementary school. Leading a class of thirty students can be a 
challenge, mainly as that many students are often hard to control. Nevertheless, I have 
planned and carried out lessons there each week for the last three years and have 
learnt a lot from it. I have found that as my confidence has grown, so the students have 
started to listen to and respect me more. They gain more from the lessons, as is evident 
from their progress at the end of each semester, and my enjoyment and fulfilment has 
risen. I am glad to have had a positive impact on their learning, and that I have been 
able to teach a subject that genuinely interests me. 
Finally, I was appointed as a school prefect for senior year. In this role, I have been 
involved with a number of charity initiatives, such as organising bake sales and 
sponsored sporting events to raise money for the Make a Wish foundation, as well as 
various pastoral activities such as mentoring incoming freshman and guiding 
prospective parents around the campus. I love being a prefect as it allows me to give 
something back to the school that has been a huge part of my life for the last several 
years. I hope my legacy is that students feel more comfortable and confident in the 
school environment, and that they are inspired to become leaders as I have been to 
give back to the community in turn."
112,"I only had one class with Tom, but his soapbox made an appearance almost every day. 
In every class conversation, he would always have a strong opinion that he would 
vocalize with no fear of judgment. It astonished me. Though I poured much time into 
developing my own opinions, I had nowhere near the confidence he had to throw them 
around freely. I doubted if they could hold up to questioning, and if not, how I would be 
perceived. 
As the year progressed, I was validated in that not all of his opinion stood up to scrutiny. 
However, I also realized that the only way to amend my own ideas was to put them on 
the line. The only way to withstand discord was to engage in it. And when coupled with 
my growing dedication to understanding others’ beliefs, I not only reflected on my own, 
but shared them, so others could internalize mine. Since then, I consistently draw on his 
intellectual confidence and the tempered thoughtfulness I have always possessed, to 
strike a balance between dialogue and introspection. Not until he came along had I 
realized the absolute importance of sharing imperfect ideas. As I have grown to 
recognize, my engagement in intellectual discourse not only works to refine my views 
but also works to constructively challenge those of others, fostering a mutually 
beneficial discussion, which though occasionally contentious, is always underpinned by 
tact and respect."
113,"Everywhere I looked, I saw a sea of white coats and scrubs; there was constant 
beeping of the heart monitors, and the smell of disinfectant was strong. 
There I stood - a diminutive, awkward high school kid - lacking in experience and 
confidence, ready to begin volunteering at Vidant Medical Center. Perhaps the very 
same qualities that made me nervous were what put patients at ease. Many patients, 
especially younger ones who were uncomfortable speaking with medical professionals, 
seemed much more comfortable in my presence. I have learned this quality is how I 
have been able to make a difference - by connecting with many of the younger patients 
who were nervous just like me. I’ll always remember the two eight-year-old brothers 
who were waiting as their father got an MRI. 
In some ways, they were also like me - they loved sports, and had an interest in math 
and science. As they were waiting, we talked about everything, from who they thought 
would win the NBA championship title to me giving them tips on how to remember their 
multiplication tables. This interaction put them at ease and kept them from becoming 
restless. 
Every time I step into the hospital, I strive to connect with people. I find that I am able to 
make a difference not strictly due to my tasks of escorting and discharging patients but 
because of connection and rapport that I establish with them. 
My initial nervousness about whether or not I would be able to assist sick and injured 
patients soon gave way to relief and gratification as I learned that I was indeed able to 
help them, by bringing a smile to those I escort, discharge, or deliver meals . I’ve met 
people I might never have met otherwise, and we’ve shared our thoughts and talked 
about our experiences. I have come to look forward to their company, who, despite their 
conditions, are still able to smile every day and enjoy engaging in conversation with me 
- and vice versa. 
Even when volunteering in areas of the hospital where I’m not in contact with patients 
as often, such as doing food preparation, I always make sure to visit the patients I 
escort after my shift, to talk to them and uplift their spirits. Volunteering at a hospital 
reminds me every day how fortunate I am to be in good health and of the rewards of 
helping those who aren’t. While my job as a volunteer at the hospital may not result in 
the discovery of a cure for cancer, I am happy to have had an opportunity to contribute 
to improving the experiences of the children and young adults coping with their hospital 
stays."
114,"Sweat drips down my face onto homework in front of me. 
I just got home from a soccer game; I’m not stressed. This is until I realize I still have a 
plethora of edits to make on my lab report as well as emails to write for an upcoming 
NHS event. AND I have three tests the next day. 
Fun. 
Although stressful, I enjoy every minute of juggling a variety of academics and 
extracurriculars. I appreciate all the opportunities my high school offers to me and I take 
advantage of as many as I can handle. Thanks to my involved years of high school, I 
have received a great education as well as many experiences I would never trade away. 
Entering my senior year and researching universities I may want to attend, there is one 
question which continuously presents itself. What do I want to major in when I get to 
college? It is a scary question and I have never known the answer. Despite participating 
in many extracurriculars such as National Honor Society, Science Olympiad, Math 
Honor Society, and Future Business Leaders of America, I still have no idea what I want 
to do with my life. 
As a student at LSA, I would be able to use the abundance of resources to explore 
possibilities for life after college. Since I am one of the many college applicants who has 
not decided upon a major, a large, liberal arts college like LSA is the perfect place for 
me to discover more about myself, pursue interests, and find my purpose. I have 
considered medicine, business, economics, and law. The two courses I have enjoyed 
the most are biomedical sciences and US History. I am truly all over the map! 
With so much variety at LSA, I would be able to change majors or take a diverse group 
of classes so that I could find what I want to study. LSA is unique from its University of 
Michigan counterparts because it offers a broader range of departments, majors, and 
courses. The flexibility at LSA would help me discover what I want my life to be like 
while supporting me through my journey. 
Additionally, LSA provides students with multiple opportunities not found anywhere else 
at University of Michigan. One program that caught my eye was Michigan Learning 
Communities. This program appeals to me because having the resources of this large 
university, yet finding a niche in the community to challenge myself and others, can help 
me grow as a student and a person. Similarly, the Opportunity Hub at LSA jumped out 
at me as I researched the University and toured the school. I would take full advantage 
of the great connections the Opportunity Hub provides, as it could help me find an 
internship or job offer when the perfect time comes. MLCs, the Opportunity Hub, and 
the many other programs which LSA offers are the main reasons why LSA would be the 
best college fit for me. 
I was initially drawn to the University of Michigan by the beautiful campus, great 
athletics programs, unmatched prestige, and massive alumni network. However, as I 
dove deeper, I discovered LSA, a school that can help me realize my purpose and 
passions while providing a focused learning environment to lead me to a bright future."
115,"While reading Tolkien's The Silmarillion, I was struck by the elegance of the Elvish 
script he included. Upon further research, I discovered that he had created an entire 
language – Quenya – to accompany the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The idea that a 
language could be crafted and cultivated like a piece of art was both illuminating and 
enticing to me. I had heard of Esperanto previously, but I don’t believe Tolkien was 
trying to change the world with his creation. His goal was simply to create a language 
for the pleasure of it, and to enrich his storytelling and worldbuilding. 
The revelation that language could be more than just a tool for communication triggered 
a desire to emulate Tolkien and create a language of my own. My first (unsuccessful) 
attempt I named ‘Ashaia’. It drew inspiration from the languages I had studied at school, 
including Spanish, French, Italian, Latin, and Ancient Greek, while conforming to unique 
phonotactical and grammatical constraints of my own devising. It was a highly 
enjoyable, rewarding, and time-consuming process that I repeated with several different 
language projects over my time in high school. 
It was creating languages (or ‘conlanging’) that introduced me to linguistics as an 
academic subject, and the college textbooks I read through my research by linguists 
such as Ti Alkire that encouraged me to pursue it at university. I have no doubt that I will 
continue to channel my passion for the subject into future creations during university 
and beyond."
116,"Bluntly put, moving in high school was difficult. I remember waving good-bye to my best 
friend through tear-filled eyes. I remember staying up the night before the first day at my 
new school, dreading having to eat lunch alone. I remember crying on my birthday. Most of 
all, I remember hating how my life had become a movie cliche, how I had seemingly been 
reduced to a shell of myself by relocating 399.2 miles south. 
Resolute in my desire to restore some semblance of normalcy, I started running 
incremental exploratory missions on this alien planet. I joined Science Olympiad, finding 
comfort in the companionship of fellow biology geeks. Fulfilling a longtime goal, I joined a 
volunteer station and became an EMT, loving the urgency of working in an ambulance and 
the unique satisfaction of saving a life. I spent countless hours reading papers about spinal 
cord stimulation, temporarily forgetting my social isolation with academic collaboration. I 
learned to drive, much to my parent’s chagrin. 
Though I still had the occasional bad day (as do we all), things were looking up. Reluctant 
optimism replaced hopeless despair as I became more confident in my abilities and less 
reliant on the context in which I applied them. Moving compelled me to meet different 
people, try new things, and succeed in an environment I hadn’t grown up in. The result was 
resilience, a firm belief that with hard work, a willingness to diversify, and a little self-
deprecation, no situation was impossible, no crisis un-manageable."
117,"I quit keeping track of how many times I've said ""Hi, welcome to Whitman!"" after my first 
Back-to-School-Night. As a member of the Whitman Navigator team for three years, I've 
greeted a few hundred parents, oriented three classes of freshmen, and built lasting 
friendships with fellow Navigators and staff. Navigators are Whitman students who lead 
Freshman Orientation and Back-to-School-Night, as well as give tours to transfer students. 
In this capacity, I've worked with our two principals, Dr. Goodwin (now retired) and Dr. 
Dodd, on building a more welcoming Whitman. The community I love best is that of my 
high school, Walt Whitman. My place is similar to that of a Walmart Greeter, in that I am the 
first person freshmen see when they enter the front door. Using my school spirit and three 
years' experience, I enthusiastically guide these freshmen through their first encounter 
with this large, and often intimidating, new community. 
Last year, I received my first question that I couldn't answer. As a chorus student, my 
knowledge of the Fine Arts at Whitman is limited; when a freshman asked me about 
ceramics courses, I paused and pondered. Rather than providing her with false 
information, I said, ""I actually couldn't tell you. 
At the end of orientation, I'll refer you to Gianni, a Navigator who took ceramics last year."" 
The closeness of the Navigator community meant that I knew the right person to answer 
her question. Here I was, answering the freshman's question in a position of authority, 
when only four years ago I was in her shoes. Navigators granted me the opportunity to help 
others acclimate to the school, and I developed leadership traits through which I could 
guide people successfully."
118,"Lou Holtz once said, “You don't go to Notre Dame to learn something; you go to Notre 
Dame to be somebody.” While I can hardly tell the difference between a linebacker, 
quarterback and fullback, I know that the advice from the former football coach rings 
true. Notre Dame will not only provide me with a wonderful education, but will equip me 
with the tools to pursue a career in government. 
Notre Dame’s emphasis on a practical political science education is what first drew me 
in. The emphasis on equipping students with the ability to do research through the 
Research Apprenticeship Course and the ability to complete a thesis allow for an 
undergraduate to get hands-on experience in helping contribute to the body of 
knowledge in political science. 
Further, the ability to obtain internships, especially with the U.S. Department of State 
and the City of Chicago Law Division emphasize the experiential learning I hoped for. 
Real-world experience will empower me to solve real-world problems and enter the 
workforce. 
While I may never understand football, with a Notre Dame education I know I will learn 
to understand political science deeply and be equipped for a successful future."
119,"A Love Letter to Target 
Dear Target, 
Home is where the heart is, and although I love my house, I have always felt my home 
is with you. I always enter with a single goal in mind and exit with an amalgam of knick-
knacks, soy candles and bags of medium-roast fair trade coffee. A brigade of 
employees dressed in red polos and khakis watch as I enter for the smallest thing and 
exit with a full cart. 
Target, you’ve seen it all. The frantic assembly of last-minute Halloween costumes, the 
first case of post-breakup Ben and Jerry’s purchases, and a giant inflatable flip-flop pool 
float. In many ways, the red of your walls has brought me comfort for all of high school, 
and I am eternally grateful for every trip. You have made every day and every shopping 
expedition an adventure, and I can’t wait to continue into college knowing that I’ll always 
have books in one hand and a bag with a red bullseye in the other. 
Sincerely yours, 
Isabella"
120,"Stepping foot in public has been like opening a floodgate to questions and comments 
about the one thing that I've been looked down upon my entire life for - my height. 
Standing out because I was 4'9"" wasn't something I was proud of; I was picked last for 
sports, not taken seriously, and often used as a human arm rest. My mom warned me 
life was going to be hard if I didn't drink my milk. However, people aren't aware that my 
appearance is a deception and what makes me extraordinary is that I've outgrown 
myself. People should be asking me how a person so ""big"" can fit into a girl so tiny. I 
have a huge personality, dreams, goals, and a plethora of talent. My achievements 
earned me such a high standing that I do know what the weather is like up there, yet, 
my head is never in the clouds because my distance from the ground makes me down 
to earth. 
My only oddity is that my anatomy has grown out of proportion. It's hard to believe that 
with such short arms, I can extend them long enough to touch hearts with my art and 
performances. I have been devoted to helping people and educating myself ever since I 
was young, but who knew that my brain and heart would become so gigantic? Despite 
my how big my brain is, I keep my head as small as my body because I value letting 
others know that I'll never overlook them. 
Although I haven't hit as many significant growth spurts as the average person. I grow 
with ambition every day, considering every moment a step closer to success. Being able 
to pursue my passions at a university will allow me to continue maturing into a person 
who will one day be looked up to by many. The reader of my response cannot see the 
facade that has been the subject of many peoples first impressions of me. instead, they 
will observe that even though I can't reach the top shelf, I can still reach my goals in life."
121,"I am a member of the Grosse Pointe chapter of YoungLife, a non-denominational 
Christian youth group. However, I wouldn't necessarily consider myself a ""Christian."" 
My relationship with God is exactly that—mine. I sometimes question certain Christian 
teachings and beliefs, and I'm not 100 percent sure that I am officially any one religion. 
This is not only OK, but encouraged at YoungLife; the motto of the organization is 
""Come as you are."" The differences between myself and the person sitting next to me at 
Sunday Club don't matter there. 
Our diverging ideas and opinions, some of which may be about religion itself, become 
white noise as we sing along with the leaders to start each Club at the YoungLife 
House. My understanding of Christianity can be polar opposite of that person—my 
friend—next to me, but we are connected in the Club's universal idea of being yourself 
and accepting others for doing the same. 
I am still figuring out my individual ideologies, and I expect it to take time before I fully 
understand my feelings. My views may will fall within those of a Christian church, they 
partially could, or they might not at all. I haven't solved my religious puzzle yet, but I 
don't feel like an outsider because of it. The people at YoungLife respect my internal 
journey. They understand that I don't fully understand my religion yet."
122,"Representing an ideal. 
Stanford is a gathering place of people working towards a common ideal; one of 
engagement, passion, intellectual vitality, and devotion to progress. This is what I stand 
for, so I want to help Stanford represent it. 
(Also those cream cheese croissants from CoHo.)"
123,"Because it took some time for me to pass my driving test, I was unable to get a 
traditional job at the same age as the rest of my peers. I had another friend who was 
also unable to drive. To fund our shopping addictions, we started our own business, 
""Velour Slimes,"" where we sold slimes of a diverse number of scents and textures. The 
experience gave us a taste of entrepreneurship and the elements of what it takes to run 
a successful business. One of those elements was collaboration. 
Going into business with a friend can get ugly, even with a small scale operation like 
ours. One of our most grueling conflicts was deciding whether to spend our first profit 
paying off our debts or buying new materials to make more slime with. Neither of us 
were transparent with our goals, or on the same page. We let our conflict escalate to the 
point where we could not look at each other. Eventually we solved our issue by 
effectively communicating together. By being honest with each other about our ideas 
and concisely supporting our arguments with evidence, we were able to understand 
each other and find a balance. In the end, we compromised. We spent half of the 
money paying off our debts and the other half on more materials to create even more 
slimes. 
This experience brought me closer to my friend. We were able to strengthen our 
relationship while becoming more understanding and considerate of each others’ 
feelings. I discovered empathy is deeply necessary in improving the negative aspects of 
modern day society. If we were all a bit more empathetic, the world would be a more 
pleasant place. For that reason, I try to continuously improve my own compassion."
124,"Growing up in a community that bleeds maize and blue, the community represented by the 
University of Michigan has always been one that I could see myself representing as both a 
student and alumni. From football games at the big house to classes at Ross, each and every 
opportunity available at U of M represents a piece of my life that I hope to continue to 
incorporate into my life for the rest of my life. 
The opportunity to take courses that allow for enriched experiences in developing a real 
business is one that I intend to be involved in as soon as possible. I will use this type of 
class as a way to test my skills and learn where I need to become stronger as a leader and 
student. Watching others equally driven as me, their tactics that are successful and not 
successful will imprint on how I attack problems in the future and shape my overall 
leadership style. 
By being involved in the Multidisciplinary Action Projects down the road as a graduate 
student, I hope to learn firsthand what it takes to run and be involved with real businesses. 
Firsthand exposure is the best way to learn how to solve problems- especially surrounded 
by peers who are equally as driven and dedicated as I am. 
Filled with students striving for nothing but the best they are capable of is a community 
that I am certain I will enrich and fit into. By sharing ideas and collaborating together 
instead of against each other, each and every one of us will contribute to the business 
world as leaders and innovators. 
The University of Michigan is a place I can see myself learning and growing as a leader for 
the next four years as I intend to use all of the tools at my disposal to become a top 
business person. The opportunities within the school I will be involved in and the peers 
that I will work beside only enrich the values of what being a Wolverine mean to me."
125,"Throughout middle school and my freshman year of high school, I was a mouse. I was 
terrified of making a spectacle of myself. The first time I walked into a DECA meeting -- 
one of only five girls in a group of 50, and the only freshman -- I nearly turned around 
and left. 
Since that day, I have earned three medals and been named a state finalist. That 
mousey freshman would never believe I could receive statewide recognition for a 
competition that required me to communicate my ideas to strangers. Walking into my 
first meeting was a huge step outside my comfort zone. Since then, my experiences in 
competitions have given me a breakthrough in self-confidence, and for that I am 
especially grateful. Not only has DECA enhanced my high school career, but it has 
helped me learn to take pride in myself and my ideas."
126,"Serving food at school carnivals, embellishing the local marsh, tutoring students after 
school, and discharging patients at my local hospital were some of the ways I actively 
supported my city. However, a distinct way of being engaged in my community involved 
being selected for the Youth Development Program last summer. This organization 
works with the Torrance Refinery and selects thirty out of hundreds of applicants. The 
first week of this program involved activities that trained students for college and 
eventually their careers by making them adept in communication, leadership, and 
teamwork skills. For the next four weeks, students were assigned a specific job around 
the City of Torrance and Torrance Unified School District (TUSD). 
I was placed in the TUSD Information Technology Department, along with six other 
students, and we essentially helped deal with technology-based issues around the 
district. Even though my professional desire incorporates biology and chemistry, I had a 
compelling interest and math and technology. I gave back to my community by utilizing 
the technological skills I gained at work. My colleagues and I traveled daily to several 
schools around the district and assisted in technological advancements: testing network 
ports and preparing schools for newer phones, imaging and updating new laptops and 
desktops, and arranging and setting up new computer labs and Chrome book carts. 
Today, many people globally use technological and visual aids to assist their education. 
My summer job also allowed me to make a difference in the education of others. With 
the faster internet, newer telephones and computers, teachers could instruct more 
efficiently and students can be educated more effectively, thus improving their academic 
performance in the future. This program helped me a lot by boosting my teamwork and 
leadership skills, which will be extremely valuable as I will be pursuing many 
president/vice-president positions in my senior year. However, this program has allowed 
me to make a stronger impact on other people rather than myself; I feel delighted that 
my work in summer will be beneficial to twenty-thousand students across Torrance."
127,"I never thought that I would tutor other people after school, but that was what I did my 
junior year and now in my senior year. During my freshman and sophomore years, I 
was the one being tutored by upperclassmen who had taken my classes before. 
Receiving help from others inspired me to become a tutor my junior year so I could give 
back and share the opportunity that I had. At first, I was not sure if I would be up to the 
task, as I did not feel confident in my teaching abilities in various subjects. As time went 
on, however, I became at ease and comfortable tutoring anyone the more I tutored 
along with my peers. 
Every day from Monday through Thursday, I went to library as much as I could to help 
tutor with others from 3 to 4 o’clock, and it slowly became a part of my daily schedule. 
To begin with, I was not the greatest teacher, but as I helped more and more, I 
gradually became better at it due to teaching the same concepts repeatedly. Not only 
was I helping the person I was tutoring understand the subject, but I also was becoming 
better at the subject by teaching it. Teaching a subject allowed me to relearn concepts 
and ideas that I had forgotten, as well as studying for a subject if I was tutoring a 
classmate. 
Motivated by wanting to help other students, I was able to be at tutoring most days, and 
this led to me receiving a tutoring award at my school’s California Scholarship 
Federation banquet at the end of the year. It was a surprise to me as I was not 
expecting to be honored. To me, the best award was the satisfaction of helping others 
understand how to do homework questions and them being grateful for the help. 
Although this year tutoring is not being held in the library yet, I joined another club that 
tutors after school for the time being so I can continue helping others and spread my 
knowledge."
128,"The spin-the-wheel slows down and eventually stops at ‘try again next time’. That is, 
until I secretly push it one slot over to ‘princess tiara’. As the child hurries away to the 
next carnival game with the tiara in her hair, her mom turns back at me with a warm 
smile and mouths the words “thank you”. Seeing genuine happiness in the people of my 
community while volunteering at events such as my school carnival always remind me 
why I love my community so much. 
I hold a lot of pride in how I’ve become a prominent figure in my community. From 
volunteering at festivals for my local elementary school to becoming employed by the 
City of American Canyon Parks and Recreation Department, I relish being in the hub of 
the community. I love our annual Fourth of July parades and Easter egg hunts, where I 
am stopped every 15 minutes to catch up with the crazy kids I worked with at summer 
camp or even just with the staff I’ve met from school. Growing up and connecting with 
such a diverse community is and will always be a large part of who I am. From 
kindergarten up until my senior year of high school, both my small community and I as 
an individual have grown immensely. By volunteering at local events, connecting with 
the people of my community, and finally getting employed by my city, I know that I have 
contributed to the successful growth of my community. 
Although I really love my community here in the small town of American Canyon, I 
cannot help but think of the other great communities that I can potentially be a part of as 
well. I believe that by going to the University of California, I will be able to thrive in the 
liveliness of the communities that the campuses are well-known for. A major 
contribution I believe that I can bring to the University of California is integrating, being 
involved in, and building the school’s community so that both I and the school can grow 
together for each other."
129,"A meaningful discussion can be found deep in the jungle of YouTube, during an 
obscure “CBS This Morning” interview with Bill Murray. 
“What do you want, that you don’t have?” - Charlie Rose 
Bill Murray - “I’d like to be here all the time, and just see what I could get done, what I 
could do if I really, you know, didn’t cloud myself... if I were able to... to not get 
distracted. To not change channels in my mind and body, to be my own channel.” 
Death is scary but my slimy, monolithic, Lovecraftian fear is unengagement. I only have 
a brief time to experience life and I know I will find the most fulfillment in “[seeing] what I 
could get done.” When I feel that signature fuzzy, tired feeling in my head, I am 
reminded of my old night terrors; I would be awake yet unable to interact with my 
surroundings. 
In sophomore year, when I discovered my passion for physics, I found a powerful way 
to stay engaged. Developing a passion fundamentally requires me, as Murray puts it, “to 
be my own channel.” Problem solving, understanding difficult concepts, having intense 
discussions all demand your mind to be present and I am more than happy to oblige. 
Intellectual vitality is not my application buzzword, it is my lifestyle."
130,"My dad lost his parents when he was young. My mom also quit her job to take care of 
me. So, if you look at it, she should loathe me. But she doesn’t. She has dedicated her 
whole life to me. That is why I want to provide a purpose to their lives. Every 
competition I won, even a small word of praise would lighten their mood. When I am 
happy they are euphoric; when I am sad they are distraught. It's like they (for)give and 
forget. So why not follow their footsteps and give it all I got?"
131,"Growing up, I tackled the challenge of school without much guidance from anyone other 
than my older sister, who is one grade higher. When I was at the young age of just five, 
my parents divorced and my sister and I were left with our dad, who we did not see 
often. Because our time with him was limited to driving us to school and home and 
dinner, we could not ask him for much help with homework or projects. Most of the time, 
we did the work ourselves or asked our uncle and aunt for help when they came on 
Saturdays. By the time we reached middle school, I was in more advanced classes, and 
although my dad had received an Associate’s Degree, he did not take advanced 
classes like I did, so he was unable to provide much help. My dad only took math up to 
geometry, and his English was not as fluent as mine, preventing him from providing 
much help. 
Once I enrolled in high school, I was able to get help from teachers, programs, and 
even my sister. With this newfound help, I overcame the struggle of not knowing what to 
do in school and life, and I learned that help is always there, but I just needed to ask. 
Throughout my time in high school, I became more motivated than I was before to do 
the best I can and overcome anything that comes my way. I was able to do this with 
help from others, and I will continue to strive for greatness, overcoming any obstacles. 
Without the help of others, I would not have had the success that I have had in school. 
My good grades are a testament to the help that I have received in order for me to be 
where I am now. Although I can say that I have overcome this challenge, there is still 
one last hurdle, which is to graduate from high school, attend college, and apply 
everything I have learned to the real world."
132,"I worked in a health clinic in the impoverished village of Amara in Sudan this summer, 
expecting to be assigned general administrative duties during my internship. However, 
those expectations were tossed out the window within the first week. I consider myself a 
pretty squeamish person, so the thought of blood oozing from any injury disgusts me in 
ways that I cannot describe in words. So naturally, I was shocked when I didn’t flinch or 
faint as I held the retractors of a ravaged knee during surgery. I can’t say that I 
confronted the daunting tasks I was given with complete confidence, but I learned from 
the experiences nonetheless. At times, I would question the challenging orders given to 
me by the faculty, but I later realized that it was due to the lack of qualified doctors and 
nurses at the village. 
I observed eleven surgeries, ranging from liver disease to a gruesome foot infection. 
The clinic worked under severe pressure, as basic resources and equipment were 
scarce, which ended badly for some patients. There was one particular patient who did 
not survive a disastrous bus crash due to the unavailability of ambulances. He was 
laying on the floor in agonizing pain for a lingering six hours. As the viscous blood 
stained the white cloth that covered him when he was brought to the clinic, I felt a surge 
of sorrow, anger, and helplessness. It was difficult for me to come to grips with the 
reality that some things cannot be undone. The emotions I felt that day slowly faded, but 
never completely receded. I left this internship satisfied with the invaluable knowledge I 
obtained, but I still feel like I needed to do more. I live a relatively privileged life, and 
don’t have to spend each day worrying about a measly injury that could end my life. At 
the time, even though I thought I was worked too hard for a high school student, I now 
know I didn't do enough. I’m eager to return to the clinic soon, and have hopes of 
gaining more experience and knowledge."
133,"I live in Ponchatoula, but I am from New Orleans. Most of my family is from there, 
including my parents, and as a result, I have grown up in a food-loving household. My 
parents and I decided to take a foodie vacation to Houston since we heard about how 
amazing the food is there. My mom suggested I research the schools in Houston so I 
could visit one while we were there. I will admit that I chose Rice simply because it was 
the highest-ranking school according to a quick Google search. I didn't do any further 
research. 
However, as soon as I stepped through the Sallyport, my nonchalance faded, and I was 
entranced. 
The beauty of the school was nearly enough for me to apply, but I was intrigued when 
my tour guide spoke about the importance of liberal arts at Rice because I have never 
been in an environment that held such respect for them. I also loved the housing system 
of Rice. It reminded me of the houses in Hogwarts from Harry Potter! I felt incredibly 
welcomed at Rice; I was pleasantly surprised when I asked the tour guide if I could visit 
the Shepherd School of Music by myself since it wasn't included in the tour, and she 
told me ""of course."" As I stepped through the unlocked doors and strolled through the 
maroon floors of the Shepherd School of Music, I didn't hesitate to inform my parents of 
my new dream school."
134,"Riding the elevator to the seventh floor of Haven Hall, my heart was practically leaping 
out of my chest. I was meeting with Dr. Jenna Bednar of the College of Literature, 
Science, and the Arts Department of Political Science, and as I recalled her credentials- 
B.A. in Political Science from Michigan, M.A. and PhD in Political Science from 
Stanford- I felt increasingly out of place. As a junior in high school with limited political 
experience, I am grateful that she agreed to take time out of her day to meet with me 
and answer my numerous questions about LSA, Michigan, and political theory. 
Upon entering her office, my eyes were drawn to bookshelves full of political literature, 
from the classics like De Tocqueville and Locke (which I read in a summer college 
program in 2017), to her own recently published work, The Robust 
Federation. Encouraged by her broad smile and having just completed an official 
campus tour, I launched into my questions. Dr. Bednar described the connections she 
and her students have made at Michigan, through LSA and in general. 
This revealed to me that the faculty would take a personal interest in my academic 
career. We discussed the average class size in LSA and the Department of Political 
Science, her academic background, and how to survive Michigan winters. Dr. Bednar 
then brought my attention to the benefits that LSA Political Science gives its students. 
For example, as head of the Michigan in Washington program, Dr. Bednar's passion for 
both political science and education was evident as she introduced me to one of 
Michigan's most influential academic programs. Although I hail from two miles outside 
the D.C. border, I aspire to participate in the Michigan in Washington program, to build 
on my internship of the past year with my delegate to the Maryland General Assembly. 
Under his guidance, I conducted nationwide policy research, attended civic association 
meetings and development forums, and traveled to our state capitol to watch the 
legislative process unfold. Consequently, an internship at the federal level is my logical 
next step toward building the foundations of a political career. 
Dr. Bednar, upon hearing about my internship with my delegate, suggested that I think 
about the Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program. I believe that this research 
program offers a unique means of building my understanding of political science. I am 
eager to apply to the UROP program in hopes of furthering my research skills within the 
complex political landscape of today. Furthermore, the variety of courses that I can 
explore as a political science major is remarkable: from ""Sports, Politics, and Society"", 
to ""Nations and Nationalism,"" the scope of topics will keep me engaged. 
When I sat down with Dr. Bednar, I expected a five-minute chat; I received forty-five 
minutes of helpful advice, political theorizing, and well wishes. Leaving her office, I felt 
energized and ready to dive into LSA Political Science right there. Her demeanor helped 
to build my confidence to boldly seek connections in my search for knowledge. I saw the 
Michigan difference firsthand, from various undergraduate opportunities for political 
science, to a universal love for the school from students and faculty alike."
135,"As you walk onto my church grounds, you would be a little befuddled. What used to be 
a small one-story home now houses the Chinese Christian Church of Columbia--the 
former garage/carport is now the sanctuary, the swimming pool has been replaced with 
the education building, and the old house is now the kitchen and fellowship building. But 
the most glaring aspect is the separate services, divided by language not time. Our 
church walks between traditional Chinese culture and contemporary American beliefs. 
Many of the ABCs (American-born Chinese) and the few Americans join together for the 
English service, centered around more contemporary worship and disciple-building. The 
older immigrant population and the Chinese students from the surrounding universities 
gather for the Chinese service, featuring more conservative worship with hymns and 
focused on outreach. 
Though we are divided by language and cultural barriers, we are joined together with a 
shared faith. While I call the English congregation home, I occasionally serve on the 
worship team for the Chinese service and as an interpreter for joint adult and youth 
events (when the Chinese and English service join together). While I serve in both 
congregations, my main focus is the children’s ministry where I am a Sunday school 
teacher and an activities coordinator. Every week, I love walking into the classroom, 
seeing the happy faces of curious children ready to learn new Bible stories despite their 
occasional rowdy and disobedient behavior. While the students learn, I share the same 
search for answers in my faith. With my church being a melting pot of cultures and 
language, we work to push aside those barriers to be joined together under one faith. 
Despite the challenges, the tight-knit community that has sprung up from our tiny house 
church has won my heart."
136,"The only reason I fear going for lunch in a hotel is probably because I wouldn’t choose 
between fried chicken and roasted meat and so is my dilemma over my college major. 
The multifaceted whole brain approach at McCormick, however, grants me the perfect 
opportunity to pursue my interest in Computer Science whilst acquiring the appropriate 
skills in entrepreneurship to a one day startup as an innovator. 
As a NU computer scientist, I particularly look forward to Software Development EECS 
473 – NUvention: Web, through which I would not only learn intricacies of Software 
development, but have related studies in real time software development in relation to 
market requirements in CS+X that would form a base for a startup. That would also 
provide a bridge for me to join Prof Todd Warren at Farley Center for Entrepreneurship 
and Innovation where I would specifically join the NUvention; Web + Media. Through 
this unparalleled program I would have the intimacy of working in a team with fellow wild 
cats towards an innovative business project. The results of which will be an introduction 
to the Northwestern Innovation and New Ventures Office (INVO) through which I look 
forward to gaining practical exposure in launching businesses to the general public. 
Outside McCormick, I would be excited to pursue the Managerial analytics Certificate 
program at Kellogg to acquire intelligent business management skills, let off steam at 
SPARK exploring hacks while fostering entrepreneurial habits, and eventually joining 
preparations for the Benedictine Eagle Invite at the Henry Crown Sport’s Pavilion 
(SPAC) with the NU track club. I may not the best of singers, but I do have intense 
phases of music obsessions and where best to let it off than taking non major classes at 
Bienen and, joining one of the numerous Acapella groups as I await Armadillo day!"
137,"What starts with the letter P and is distinct to Louisiana and not the other forty-nine 
states? This question stumped my fifth-grade class when our resource teacher was 
giving a lesson on Louisiana culture. Among hands that threw out guesses, such as 
ports and Lake Pontchartrain, my minuscule fingers, like unwrapping a Christmas 
present, unveiled the correct response: parishes. It was this moment that sparked my 
awakening of Louisiana’s profoundly unique traditions and history, ranging the gamut of 
culture, such as food, music, and holidays. 
From Gumbo to Zydeco to Mardi Gras, these distinctions made Louisiana my home 
when I emigrated at the age of three from Mexico, which, like Louisiana, shared the 
status of owning an inimitable culture; from an early age, I took comfort in this common 
characteristic. Basking in rich traditions, Tulane joins Louisiana and my Hispanic 
background to form a trio of diversity. With staple practices, such as swinging beads 
into a tree or Crawfest, Tulane fosters a living and learning experience that is grounded 
in unparalleled traditions, offering enlightening and invigorating undergraduate 
opportunities to explore social milestones. 
In its liberation from normal college practices, Tulane encourages students to kindle a 
life that is eccentric but indicative of the individual beliefs of a student. Because of 
Tulane’s vigorous ties to special traditions, I would be humbled to have Tulane advise 
me in crafting my art piece adorned with decorations, my life adorned with personal 
values. 
In addition to the customs on Tulane’s campus, another reason I want to attend Tulane 
is because of the university’s integration with the most vivid city in the United States: 
New Orleans. Inside this bright, bustling city, Tulane students participate in myriad 
festivals and celebrations, cultivating a new social perspective. Aside from the social 
revelations, New Orleans is Tulane’s classroom, inviting students to apply classroom 
discussions and academic theories to the neurons of interactions between individuals, 
businesses, agencies, and other entities. 
Tulane returns the favor to New Orleans through community service, serving as a 
catalyst for students to aid a city often decimated by natural or social injustices. 
Moreover, Tulane emphasizes its commitment to community service throughout its 
undergraduate population. As a Louisiana resident, I am invested in Louisiana’s unique 
physique, whether it is being ecstatic for a super bowl win secured by the Saints or 
being sympathetic to victims of flooding. Heeding the advice of a stockbroker, it is wise 
to invest in a system that will provide a generous, satisfying return. Therefore, I would 
like to make an investment of my leadership potential, my academic excellence, my 
service dedication, and my social experiences into Tulane University. This investment 
would reap mutualistic rewards because I would be the beneficiary of a robust 
education and Tulane would be the beneficiary of a loyal student, who is pious to the 
university’s commitments to diversity, learning, and service."
138,"At Duke I was equally entranced by the articulate movements of 3D printers in the Co-
Lab and the stunning Gothic architecture. Instead of forming a dichotomy, these aspects 
of Duke blended to symbolize its emphasis on interdisciplinary education, which will 
offer me a nuanced perspective of the world integral to becoming a leader in 
engineering. 
I will join the Academy for Model Aeronautics and share my passion for designing 
drones, while taking fascinating courses such as “Taboo Markets” and “Banality of Evil”, 
while simultaneously working on an engineering project that improves real people’s lives 
in “Engineering Design”. By joining the Duke Robotics Club, I can expand upon my love 
for robotics, and I hope to write for the Duke Engineering magazine, as well as join the 
Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers. By drawing from this diverse range of 
educational experiences, I can become a leader in creating a better future."
139,"I ask a lot of questions. Of myself, of people around me, of Google. They can range 
from “How does meditation modulate pain perception?” to “What can we do about 
education inequality?” to “Why does my dog bark when I let the air out of a blood 
pressure cuff?”, encompassing the mundane, the unanswerable, and everything in 
between. I crave not just the answer, but the journey that leads me to it. Though the 
“journey” usually consists of a 4-second Google search, I relish when it doesn’t. As 
EMT’s, we’re told to embrace the unknown, an imperative in an unpredictable 
environment. With research, the unknown is a challenge, a welcome invitation to 
unravel the reasons behind natural phenomena. I’ve had the privilege to work in a 
neuroscience research lab the past two years, to be frustrated, awed, and humbled by 
what is left to discover about the brain. 
In my time there, I’ve explored the mechanism of action for high frequency spinal cord 
stimulation, used electroencephalography to understand the analgesic effects of 
mindfulness meditation, and loved every minute of it. I’ve learned that research is a 
process of endless doubt, with one question inspiring twenty more. It is this infinite 
possibility that captivates me, so compels me to seek out opportunities where the 
unknown is actively sought out. With its countless undergraduate research 
opportunities, ties to the Rehab Neural Engineering Lab, and Dr. Seal’s work in actually 
pinpointing specific populations of neurons responsible for persistent pain, the 
University of Pittsburgh fosters such an environment. Should I be accepted, I can’t wait 
to dive in and do my small part in making just a little bit of the unknown, known."
140,"There was a time when I was low and afraid to be with myself. That’s when I dived into 
programming. I always sat with my laptop. But unlike others on Instagram or Snapchat, I 
was coding. I always kept myself occupied so I wouldn’t think about hardships. But as I 
was solving those little Instantiation and StackOverflow errors, I realized that any 
problem in my life had a solution. I could either modify the code and right the wrong, or 
just keep compiling them, producing no output. So, life is not all that different. That is 
why I want to pursue Computer Science. I know I can work to keep myself happy. 
Inevitably, what makes me happy is Computer Science, which is what I want to pursue."
141,"“Leland, you need a better hobby."" 
This is the universal reaction amongst my friends and family when I tell them one of my 
favorite pastimes: learning about presidential elections. 
For me, elections are an exciting combination of many different subjects, which I take 
upon myself to untangle. There’s a heavily quantitative portion of elections, which 
involves calculating the paths each candidate can take to achieve 270 electoral votes. 
Speculating about how a candidate could’ve won is one of my favorite parts of politics. 
Take one of my favorite anecdotes: the state that lost Al Gore in the election of 2000 is 
his home state, Tennessee, not Florida. Gore could have won the election if he had put 
any amount of money into Tennessee, but he just assumed that he could carry the state 
since he was from there. 
Social sciences also play an indispensable part in elections. For one, there are 
demographic trends - who's voting, and who are they voting for? How many votes do 
we need from Detroit for Hillary to carry Michigan? Finally, the most important part of 
elections to me are the issues that define and drive the election. Each year there are a 
varying set of divisive issues which each candidate must take a stance on in the hopes 
that their views will resonate with American citizens. These issues help people like me 
decide who to vote for, and although I've never voted in one, I love presidential 
elections."
142,"As a global citizen and more literally an American citizen, I hope we find common 
ground. World affairs, as I understand them, veer wildly between extremes. Though this 
change can occur over decades, the world as a whole, and our country specifically, 
experiences radical swings between populism and elitism, far left and far right doctrine. 
The natural reaction to an extreme ideology is the rise of its opposite: the process is 
cyclical. This extreme swing means constant division; one group vehemently fighting to 
keep their ideas in power and the other willing to sacrifice anything to destroy them. 
Rarely is their moderation, rarely is their compromise. 
This lack of general balance in a countries dogma means little long-term change. 
Substantive action from one group is later demolished when the other gains power. 
Nationalism is used to attack the opposition, not to unify the country, and simulated 
existentialism disenfranchises many. For the good of us all, it’s time for change. 
Admittedly this is idealistic, and amending this issue is not in the power of any one 
world-leader or bureaucrat. But I’m optimistic. In The United States, there is a vocal 
minority urging compromise, and though their voices are in danger of being drowned 
out, they have a far more compelling argument than those advocating the extremes. I 
hope for this change with the understanding that my community is rational and 
reasonable, and that with mutual respect and moderation, we can make the practical 
changes that best serve our world."
143,"Working as a nanny has taught me much more than any club or organization could. 
Growing up with a single mom, I wasn’t always the primary focus: I had to learn how to 
take care of myself and carve my own path. Now, being a nanny enables me to be a 
role model and guide for kids whose parents might not have the time or ability to do so. 
And as the child of a working parent, I’m also aware of the constant stress parents are 
under. 
Not only does being a nanny teach me how to handle the responsibilities of caring for a 
child, it also allows me to reminisce on my childhood. Whether I’m helping David with 
his Spanish homework, teaching Edward how to say hi, or finding Leprechaun footprints 
with William, I can feel the unique impact I’m making on their lives, an impact which is 
irreplaceable."
144,"Mandy is my mentor from Big Brothers Big Sisters and someone who's changed my life. 
It sounds insane to bring a 38 year old woman to college with you, but don't worry, that's 
not my plan. As I gaze at my bedroom wall, I'm surrounded by photos of all the great 
adventures we've shared. These pictures showcase some of my all-time highs: from my 
first checking account and the first time I had sushi to me hunched over a counter trying 
to master the making of a great granola. 
When I look back, I see a girl who's been inspired to make astounding changes in her 
life as a result of an amazing woman. That girl is me, and when I walk into this new 
chapter of my life, I'll bring those pictures so that every day I'll be reminded of my 
mission. I want to give little girls and boys all over the world the opportunity to do 
something bigger than themselves--to change someone's life just as Mandy had 
changed mine. Some people may just see a photo of a girl holding two books, but I 
know she smiles because she was given a chance at success."
145,"Entelechy is a beautiful question. With it, your soul unfolds, surrendering itself to the 
infinite jewels of knowledge. Your inquiry creates an interlude in time, an interlude which 
exposes your core beliefs to adversity. Sometimes you receive a reply to your inquiry. 
Often in instances like these, your soul feels satisfied. But sometimes, there is no 
answer. Thus, in an effort to fill the unsettling vacuity within, your spirit adventures on a 
long and winding journey, tearing through the finitudes and infinitudes of research and 
discovery. And your spirit, upon reaching your own answer, recognizes the potential 
within. 
Entelechy is an enchanting piece of artwork. In the split second you gaze upon it, you 
find yourself puzzled; you can’t grasp it’s meaning. The forward rush of life falls flat. But 
upon further examination, you realize all of it’s fine intricacies: the light, curvilinear 
brushstrokes, the hint of anachronistic paraphernalia, the subtlety of the monochromatic 
colors. And then, like a comet pouring through the sky, meanings spill into your mind 
and suddenly you realize your ability to observe the world past the opaque lens. The 
artwork is no longer merely paint on a canvas, no, not anymore —it’s entelechy. 
Entelechy is loving your education. It’s holding a book close to your heart and feeling an 
exhilaration. It’s talking to teachers and students and immersing yourself in their 
knowledge and experiences. It’s letting the pages of that fascinating essay you’ve been 
reading spill through your fingers like silk. It’s feeling ready to conquer the world. 
For Aristotle, entelechy is the vital force which accomplishes self-fulfillment. By always 
endeavoring to achieve entelechy, I am emerging from my cave of limitations, exploding 
outward to attain enlightenment, and glowing as strong as the glittering morning sun 
that emerges behind the mountains."
146,"The activity which I am most passionate about and plan to continue is soccer. Soccer 
has taught me multiple skills applicable to all aspects of life. These include leadership, 
teamwork, and work ethic. As captain of the soccer team, I have taken away various 
lessons I can apply in life. For instance, I have improved not only giving constructive 
criticism, but also receiving it- something which I am still working toward. Similarly, I 
have learned to be a better teammate, as soccer is reliant on playing together. Most 
significantly, soccer has brought me a desire to work hard, as being great requires so 
much more than pure talent. The impact of soccer on my life has created a new 
challenge for my future. I would like to continue playing because I want to take what I 
have learned and expand on it, and ultimately teach these lessons to others."
147,"In elementary school, multiplication tables were the ultimate conquest. Each day, 
students would take their seats, filled with either anticipation or dread of the timed 
multiplication practice they would inevitably receive. To me, these worksheets were a 
challenge- an opportunity for me to prove to myself and others that I had mastered the 
art of third-grade math. However, I did not realize that a fellow classmate would 
motivate me to achieve ambitions beyond multiplication. Every day, this classmate 
expertly completed his multiplication with time to spare. As the year progressed, the 
teachers noticed his mathematical skill and allowed him to attempt the next step—
division. 
I jealously watched as he attempted division while I continued working through the 
same monotonous problems, and eventually realized that if he could master 
multiplication, I could too. I began to practice my multiplication tables at home, and, at 
school, every timed quiz brought me closer to excellence. Finally, after what seemed 
like years of hard work, my teacher allowed me to progress to the division worksheets 
with my classmate. Without realizing it, this classmate pushed me to work my hardest 
and take my learning outside of the classroom. He motivated me to learn and inspired 
me to be the best version of myself. Because of this classmate, I work harder in school, 
always push myself, and, above all, believe that anything is achievable if I try my 
hardest."
148,"For as long as I can remember, riding horses has played an integral part of my day to day 
life. It has taught me more than I could learn anywhere else and truly morphed my 
character forever. Riding has become a key part of my identity. Spending 30+ hours a week 
at the barn in addition to nearly 20 weekends of the year at horse shows, it has shown me 
the impact that long term effort has on success. This time commitment has also allowed me 
to make close friends that I hope to stay connected with for the rest of my lifetime. Riding 
has ultimately become more than a sport to me, but rather part of my life: a part of my life 
that I will treasure for as long as I am alive."
149,"I was named after my great-grandmother, Robab. Robab was an exceptionally poised 
Persian woman, one who defied the traditions imposed on her sex by obtaining an 
education. She taught herself how to read, eventually graduating with a high-school 
diploma-- something unheard of for her time. 
As a young girl, I was moved by her desire to learn. But her death from lung cancer 
deeply saddened me. Had she received an inexpensive form of cancer therapy, would 
she still be alive? Equipped with my lab notebook and ScienceDirect, I began to 
diagram the chemical romance between pHEMA-VP nanoparticles and cancer drugs. 
Suddenly, towering amounts of research on aspirin as a potential cancer therapy landed 
upon my desk, drowning at the mercy of my neon highlighter. I let my imagination run 
wild and untamed, ready to invent a therapy that could prevent deaths worldwide. 
I figured that developing aspirin-loaded pHEMA-VP hydrogel nanoparticles as a novel 
cancer therapeutic would be uncomplicated research. While trying to create my 
nanoparticles, however, my visions were not as romantic. Obstacles came by the 
minute. Because there were few publications on my area of research, I had to invent my 
own polymerization methods, most of which failed miserably. When I began 
internationally collaborating with two Singaporean research partners, I felt they were 
outperforming me in my own research. Finally, after months of destroyed flasks and 
hair-pulling despair, our nanoparticles were successfully created. They cost $8.60/gram. 
Doxil, a famous cancer-therapy nanoparticle alternative, costs $246.80/milligram. 
Though the obstacles were immensely challenging, my research has allowed me to 
experience a spiritual transformation. Like Robab, I no longer relinquish in the face of 
failures. For it is failure which renders growth and success. Instead, I wholeheartedly 
embrace the paradigm of obstacles, transcending with knowledge, with courage, with 
power."
150,"There’s a moment in the 2017 film The Florida Project where our young protagonist, 
seven-year-old Moonee, stands with a friend in front of a cow pasture. See, she says 
triumphantly, gesturing to the grazing animals as if presenting prizes on a game show. I 
took you on a safari. Without hesitation, she runs toward the cows, laughing: Let’s go. 
In Moonee’s world, ordinary cows are majestic creatures, and she wants nothing more 
than to chase them. She plucks small pleasures from the mundane, turning dilapidated 
pastures into exotic landscapes. She pursues these things with a rare kind of love: pure, 
exuberant, fiercely determinate.  
The Florida Project e ncourages me to chase the small things in my life with immense 
passion, with a Moonee-esque determination to live breathlessly, unhesitatingly. This 
film beckons me to run forward to the cows, nudging me into the world as if to say: Let’s 
go."
151,"“Give Oberlin a look” my father suggested. A school I knew little about. I casually added 
Oberlin to the long list of schools of which Tufts was perched atop. My father had gone 
to Tufts and I had convinced myself that I should follow. 
Adding Oberlin to my list begat the serendipitous series of events that ultimately saw a 
fly-in invitation to Oberlin in my email inbox. My father encouraged me to go; “It doesn’t 
hurt to listen”. 
The most influential component of Oberlin were the people. My host, Estrella, like every 
Oberlin student I met, was generous with her time and her experiences. It wasn’t 24 
hours before I could imagine myself laughing with friends at the 10 pm dinner, dozing off 
on a swing bench in Tappan square, spending late nights at the library in a womb chair, 
or petting kittens in some little art store. Sharing a day with these people who were 
clearly in the right place brought some force to my mind that Oberlin was the right place 
for me. My short trip revealed that Oberlin offered me both the academic rigor I seek 
and the visceral experience of living in a community of people with broadly varying 
backgrounds─an experience that I had in this small Ohio town and nowhere else. 
I don’t know whose essay I’d be writing right now if this opportunity had never presented 
itself, but I am very grateful it did."
152,"At 10:30 pm on a hot, summer, Wednesday night, you would expect my friends and me 
to be having the time of our lives and going out on crazy high school adventures— but 
instead, we were actually stuck in a chemistry laboratory trying to map out the Lewis 
structure of sulfuric acid. 
Over the summer of my sophomore year, my friends and I enrolled into ‘Introduction to 
Chemistry’, an evening course at our local community college. As a six-week summer 
course, I spent two hours in lecture, two hours in the laboratory, and another two hours 
studying on my own for four days a week for six weeks. It was evident that I struggled 
with adjusting to the pace of college when I received 19% on a quiz. I felt left behind, 
exhausted, and overall pathetic. No matter how many hours I spent studying, I couldn’t 
keep up. But instead of giving up, I picked up certain strategies like reading the material 
the night before, rewriting my notes, and joining a study group; eventually working my 
way up to a B. 
At the end of that summer, I learned so much more than just chemistry. On top of 
having the raw experience of what college is like, my chemistry experience taught me 
that it is okay to fail. I discovered that failure is an essential part of learning. Coming to 
this realization inspired me to take more college courses and rigorous courses in high 
school. I transformed into a hungry learner, eager to fail, learn, and improve. By seizing 
the opportunity to take this course, I pushed myself beyond my limits. This experience 
and realization changed how I wanted to pursue the rest of high school, college, and life 
in general. 
I walked into my first day of the chemistry class expecting to walk out with an A; but 
thankfully, I didn’t. Instead, I walked out of that class with a taste of the college 
experience and a principle that I now live by-- that it is okay to fail, as long as you get 
back up."
153,"I petitioned for an introductory law class, but my high school principal rejected the idea. 
There were not any introductory online courses apt for me. Since I could not find law 
opportunities, I created my own opportunity; during the late summer of 2017, I 
completed two law internships. 
I created this opportunity while accompanying my aunt to court. There, I met Judge 
Wolfe and Attorney Butler. I spoke with both of them for a while, and eventually I asked 
if I could complete an internship with them. They both agreed eagerly! I shadowed both 
of them in their separate offices as well as in the court room. I took notes and recalled 
important information they taught me. I learned so much that I would not have found 
from a simple google search, and I made many connections with people that offered to 
help me with my career goals."
154,"For the past five years, I have participated in a service group called CTeen (Chabad 
Teen Network). It is comprised of about twenty-five Jewish teenagers from surrounding 
high schools. Every Sunday morning we have breakfast and class with our rabbi. We 
discuss current events and world dilemmas from a Jewish point of view. These 
discussions have deepened my understanding of Judaism and brought me closer 
to other members of CTeen. Through CTeen I have met many of my closest friends. My 
chapter annually travels to Brooklyn for a shabbaton in Crown Heights with 200 other 
CTeen chapters from around the world. Every year during this time I am imbued with 
the dedication of my community to our faith, and I experience a heightened connection 
to both Judaism and my friends. As president of my CTeen chapter and member of the 
International CTeen Leadership Board, I continue to be impacted by the authentic ideas 
and dedicated people I meet."
155,"New England. Apple Cider, Lobster Rolls, Clam Chowder, Fall Foliage. Dead Leaves, 
N’oreasters, Blizzards. 
The unique corner of America where I live raises conflicting feelings in me. New England is 
a place where beautiful colors envelop you when autumn appears but also where bitter 
blizzards leave you in despair when winter takes hold. A place with strong values rooted in 
its deep history but also where change is often rejected in favor of tradition. 
As much as I love the possibility of a white Christmas, I despise the sight of muddy slush on 
the roadside as I drive to school. There is nothing I would love more than to be rid of the 
biting cold and terrible snowstorms. Of course, we couldn’t do that without discovering 
some outrageous new technology to shut down Earth’s natural phenomena. But that would 
create bigger problems, so maybe we should stay away from that idea and just hope for 
some forgiving weather this year! 
Blizzards aside, one of my biggest issues with New England lies in its lack of decent public 
transportation. Our weather is worse than that of many parts of Europe, but Europe solves 
this problem with phenomenal public transportation including modern metros, efficient 
bus systems, and high-speed rail networks. One day, I hope we can emulate that level of 
interconnectedness and convenience in New England and throughout America. I hope this 
historically significant region might serve as a catalyst for technological and infrastructural 
change throughout America, changing history once more."
156,"I was born in California, USA. When I was about 7 months old, I moved to Bangalore, 
India. I've lived in Bangalore all my life, until two years ago. I started attending a 
boarding school, in the same state, but far away from my house. I chose to leave 
everything behind, even my phone, because I didn't want to be pampered. I wanted to 
fold my own blanket; to wipe my own tears; to carve my own name; to befriend people 
my way; to create my destiny. My parents weren't happy at first, but I convinced them."
157,"Recording devices have been banned from the courtroom of the Supreme Court 
Building since 1946. Therefore, when the Court makes a landmark decision, interns 
must hand-deliver paper copies of the ruling to news organizations. 
The interns often pair running shoes with their business attire, for the quarter-mile sprint 
from the Court building to the area where networks await. 
When I first saw photographs of “The Running of the Interns”, I wanted nothing more 
than to be one of those people. I wanted to feel my running shoes beating against the 
sidewalks, to feel sweat staining my suit. 
Why did this tradition attract me to journalism? Because it reminded me that the news is 
a race, a constantly-changing collection of stories shaping social and political 
development. 
The opportunity to contribute to that collection is why, beyond Ithaca’s journalism 
program, I’m also interested in the College’s minors in Politics and Writing. 
I think all of this desire to be part of a story defines what it means to be a journalist, a 
writer: When I become a journalism major at Ithaca College, and, later, perhaps a 
running intern, I get to be a contender in the race to change the world."
158,"The sounds of my knife striking kale unnerves my cat asleep in the corner. He quickly 
runs over to examine the situation but becomes instantly uninterested when he sees 
green and smells bitterness. Unfortunately, my family has this same reaction every day 
of every week. 
They question, “It’s bad enough that you’re going to eat kale, but do you really have to 
massage it?” I respond with a deep breath, during which I recall information from 
nutritionfacts.org. I begin to explain, “Well you see, it takes away the bitterness, 
because kale is composed of cellulose, so when you massage it with a strong acid–”but 
as I continue to delve into my rather scientific and oftentimes molecular rationale behind 
transforming myself into a masseuse to make a salad, everyone begins snoring. I guess 
no one has ever understood my immense love for the science behind cooking (and 
probably never will). 
Sure, my family, friends, small, undiverse and traditional high school all look at me like I 
am crazy, but I guess that is because I am. I do not look at kale and think “dark green, 
bitter, disgusting plant.” Instead, I see proteins and anticarcinogenic properties--
analyzing the anatomy of food seems to occupy my mind. 
Cooking is an art, visual, creative and instinctive. My favorite nights are spent with knife 
in hand and sweet potatoes in the oven. Food is my artist outlet, and one of the few 
things to feed my soul (and my stomach, too)."
159,"I first read the poem “Self Reliance” by Ralph Waldo Emerson in 9th grade and fell in 
love. My impressionable self read the line “Nothing can bring you happiness but 
yourself” and was inspired to pursue my dream of becoming famous. Well, since that 
did not work out (not yet), I am often in need of the reminder that I (and only I) can 
dictate my outlook on life. 
Once I rid myself of the extremities of life, dusted away the cobwebs dousing the mind 
in indistinct intention, I was able to find my true purpose. I think that Emerson’s 
definition of resilience often pervades the surfaces of modern day personas. Society is 
lacking the ability to look inward to solve problems and cure the infectious disease of 
unhappiness. I now know, unlike too many others, that I need only look inside myself to 
cure any disease of my mind."
160,"If I had a fatal flaw it would be loyalty. Of all the things I value, the one thing I value the 
most is my family. Coming after family is my friends; I consider my friends to be an 
extended branch of family. My close friends know that I value my friendship and that I 
would do almost anything for them if they asked me. I am very trusting with my friends, 
because I know that if I am there to support them, they will be there to support me. 
Without my friends, I would not be who and where I am now, as they have helped me 
through my years and shaped me to be the trusting and loyal person I am. 
Very often, I put my friends before me, and this is because I know that if I were in the 
same situation as them, they would opt to help me. My loyalty to my friends helps them 
understand why I do what I do, and it helps me make even more friends. Wherever I go, 
I want to go with friends, because I believe that I can go farther when I have others with 
me rather than going fast and alone, but not as far."
161,"If given the opportunity to paint a message on Beta Bridge, I would be doing a 
disservice to myself if I chose anything else but the phrase “if there’s a will, there’s a 
way.” It’s something I tell myself, quite literally, everyday - often out loud. If something 
doesn’t pan out the way it I had hoped despite giving it my all , then I know there must 
be something bigger and brighter that will come along. 
Observing the stress-riddled hallways at my high school, I overhear far too many of my 
classmates worrying that they do not have enough time to complete something or that 
they just “can’t do it”. But the truth is, nearly anything can be accomplished if you give it 
one hundred percent effort and dig deep to find the grit to make it happen. A reminder of 
these words on campus would serve as the same purpose that they do for me: reassure 
others that they can accomplish anything with grit and perseverance. 
This phrase has played a role in my career as a student a and saved me on nights 
where I find myself sitting in a pile of homework or facing a hectic week. Outside of 
class, it has embodied the relationship with my closest friend, Stephen, who lives hours 
away from me. Through strategic facetiming and a continual flow of messaging, our 
friendship remains closer than most of my friends who live just minutes from my house: 
a result of both of us making an effort to see success."
162,"Growing up, my absolute favorite part of Thanksgiving was always the end: pie. Blueberry, 
pecan, pumpkin- you name it, and I’ll eat it. Because of my strong love for pie, my eyes lit up 
in math class the first time I heard reference to the number, pi. While I was originally 
disappointed to learn that this kind of pi was not edible, I would later become fascinated by 
pi and what it stood for. 
Moving into higher levels of math, the little π symbol gained a much more substantial 
meaning. Understanding that pi actually represented the ratio of a circle’s circumference to 
its diameter, it started to play a greater role in my math through equations and formulas. 
I also became fascinated by the difference it made in calculations when 3.14 was used to 
represent pi: much like a crust without filling, it just does not have the same result. The 
slightest difference in 3.14 and the small character could change an entire problem: much 
like one person can change an entire situation. 
My fascination with pi and its irrationalness spread into my everyday life as I began 
recognized the importance that a small difference can make, whether in an equation or real 
life."
163,"People having a defined interest is an aspect of medieval times which failed to carry 
over to the modern era. We tend to have a ton of different interests because of the 
integration of social media in our daily lives, which gives us access to more resources 
than we can handle. We will do as many activities as we can but not love any of them, 
because of pressure to make money instead of doing what you love. I'll be the first to 
admit I suck at art. I love learning about art, but I can draw and paint with the skill of an 
orangutan. I have learned to focus my life on politics, which interests me more than any 
other field. I gain knowledge about politics from engaging with either strangers while 
canvassing or an expert while doing research. Engaging with integrity is when we do 
something we love."
164,"There aren’t many places where everyone is free from prejudice. One exception is a 
basketball court. The first time I stepped on a basketball court, I was expecting the usual 
joke about my race or the judgmental questions about my culture. But they never came. 
Everyone I met had unique perspectives on everything, from basketball itself to politics, 
and they were open and willing to share. 
I began to open up more about my background – how I couldn’t tie my own shoes until I 
was 10 and that I’m the only person in my family who loves hip-hop music. I was willing to 
share my experiences because there were no judgments made about me. Despite living in 
an ethnically homogenous area, on the court, I met and connected with people who have 
different backgrounds and interests. Coleman, now one of my best friends, who is in love 
with Greek architecture, or Gavin, who is the only member of his family who isn’t a Packers 
fan. 
The culture of unity and acceptance that is fostered is not due to the courts themselves, but 
due to the common goal everyone shares. I hope my community will find ways to build 
more places that promote what I have experienced on the basketball court – areas where 
everyone is respected for their perspectives rather than judged by their race, religion, or 
beliefs."
165,"Julia (I’ve changed her name) had always sat behind me in calculus. We traded snippets of 
our lives in the five minutes between math problems. One Friday night, I answered an 
unexpected FaceTime from Julia. She told me about her family, how her dad had committed 
suicide after her mom threatened to leave him. She described how her brother had 
physically abused her, leaving her bloody on the bathroom floor. She recounted calling the 
police after her boyfriend threatened to jump off a window ledge. I was left speechless. 
The next morning, I remembered the classic Freudian glacier diagrams with only 10% of a 
person residing above water. Julia was an avid artist, a budding mathematician, yet she was 
living with pain most adults would find unbearable. Looking at the jeans she had painted 
herself in Starry Night’s likeness, basking in the warm glow of her wit, there was simply no 
way of knowing what obstacles she had to overcome. I had always taken having a 
supportive family for granted, rarely ever considering that for many, home was a 
punishment and not a sanctuary. While the mild success I had enjoyed in school existed 
primarily because of my ever-encouraging parents, hers existed in spite of them, making 
everything she had accomplished all the more remarkable. My respect for Julia is 
immeasurable. She taught me not only resilience by example, but never to assume, to never 
disregard what most likely lies just beneath the surface."
166,"In an era where cruelty is commonplace and kindness is a commodity, there is 
widespread misuse of social media. It is advantageous in theory but, combined with the 
nature of our society, it becomes a vehicle for negativity. In my eyes, it should serve as 
an artistic outlet or means of communication. Engaging with integrity means sharing our 
lives with others, whether it be to distant relatives or close friends, via one medium. 
Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram are valuable websites, yet their true purposes seem to 
be forgotten. Social media is meant to be used for expression, whether it be artistic or 
comedic, not for the perpetuation of negativity. It is a useful tool, yet unusable by 
society. I allow my true persona to shine through my posts because I believe that 
integrity is synonymous with authenticity and that social media should act as a window 
rather than a facade."
167,"With my aspirations to pursue a career in law, I would continue with youth court. 
Restorative justice is a concept that repairs damages and restores harmony. Instead of 
merely correcting illegal actions, an offender is integrated back into the community as a 
productive member of society. As a member, this is the greatest sense of satisfaction. 
Allowing someone the chance to change truly displays why I have remained devoted to the 
program for years. 
At the University of Michigan, I would continue my restorative justice journey by involving 
myself in the Office of Student Conflict Resolution. I understand people have faults, which 
lead to disputes. With my vast experience with a variety of cases, I can assist others in 
making amends. Therefore, I am hopeful that I would be selected as a Student Resolution 
Panelist to be further educated on methods and approaches using restorative justice."
168,"Sharp ambition recedes to a dull afterthought under the vast blue sky. There is nothing 
to prove, only a trail to be hiked. Human worries have no place here, are as alien as 
concrete and WiFi. Thoughts of chemistry competitions, English essays, and college 
loans fade into nonexistence. A stream gurgles nearby, white noise in the greenest of 
places. Surrounded by unassuming simplicity, I am home. 
I started hiking before I could read the trail signs. I’ve been skiing for 12 years. Nature 
presents an opportunity not just for individual tranquility, but for being with family free 
from modern distractions. A tradition as ingrained as making cozonac at Christmas, the 
commitment to spending time outdoors is a rare source of common ground for my 
family. After eight hours on the trail, we eat at the same cafe, our legs streaked with 
dried mud. My mom predictably orders the Reuben while my dad orders salad and 
steals our fries. There is something warmly comforting in our routine; no matter the 
arguments that inevitably arise after four of us are stuffed in a car together, everything 
else recedes away once we step outside, slowly disappearing with the fading whoosh of 
cars on the highway. 
I’ve trekked hundreds of miles in the mountains of upstate New York, fished in the cold, 
salty waters of Talkeetna, marvelled at the sun setting over Arches National Park. No 
matter the landscape, be it red rocks or blue ocean, I am continually humbled by the 
natural world and its capacity for fostering human connection."
169,"“Kings have riches widely lain, 
Lords have land, but then again, 
We have friends and song no wealth can buy.” 
- “Here’s to Song” by Allister MacGillivray 
Whether it was french horn, singing, or piano, music has been integral to my mental 
development, and has provided me an enriching outlet to immerse myself in outside the 
classroom. Sadly, 1.3 million American elementary school students lack access to 
music classes due to funding cuts. Music should not belong solely to children in 
privileged, affluent schools; during my college experience, I aim to tackle this issue. 
During my UNC visit, I fell into conversation with a current student, Evan Linnett, about 
Musical Empowerment, an organization that he leads. UNC’s commitment to equipping 
the next generation with the power of music is inspiring; my vision is to take this a step 
further. Aspiring applicants attend college-run summer programs for the experience of 
staying on campus; however, almost all of these programs are academic. 
I envision a service-based UNC Music summer program, one that fills up dorms over 
the summer, provides a service opportunity to high school students from all over the 
country, and free basic music education to children in the RTP area, who perhaps can’t 
afford summer camp or music lessons. As a musician, I feel that it is our duty to use the 
opportunities we have been blessed with to make music accessible to children of 
marginalized communities across the country. 
This isn’t an RTP problem; it’s a national problem. But it starts with one."
170,"I opened my email on the first day of junior year to these words: “Like a phoenix rising 
from the ashes, Chess Club has returned once more to bless our Halls”. The sender 
was Donald Hasler, one of the most remarkable people I have ever met. Don and 
another student decided to revive the dormant Chess Club. Don, however, wanted it to 
be about much more than chess; he hoped to create a place where all types of students 
could unite. He succeeded in this goal through a weekly series of hilarious emails and 
constant outreach to the student body, from the most reserved students to the most 
rambunctious. A few months into school, Chess Club was not only the most popular 
club but also one of the most welcoming communities. Regardless of their knowledge of 
chess, students of different ages and interests come together once a week to play. 
Don has become, for me, a model of the take-charge attitude essential to success in 
today’s world. He has taught me to emulate his leadership with nothing more than 
determination, a sense of humor, and an open mind, in order to develop a collaborative 
and cohesive group of students. Over the past year, I have helped bring a host of high 
school underclassmen into Math Team, helping them find a unique extracurricular 
interest and a group of fun, caring peers and role-models. Math Team has now joined 
Chess Club as the only clubs in the school with 100 members."
171,"I am a Democrat, and Jack is as Republican as they come. True friendships are not 
possible between people with vastly different ideologies. At least that’s what I had 
originally thought. We have played basketball, done homework, gone out to lunch, 
laughed at memes, mourned bad grades, gossipped about teachers, and done 
everything that most friends do. 
We have also had some of the most interesting political discussions; passionate, but 
without rancor or judgment. In the process I have learned many things. All it takes is a 
mutual willingness to listen intently and not constantly think of a repartee. Productive 
dialogue is more important than the instant gratification of defeating someone’s 
argument. The mutual respect Jack and I have for each other’s disparate political 
opinions is something most people wouldn’t imagine possible. 
My political beliefs have only become stronger through our friendship, but so too has my 
understanding of divergent perspectives. I think that milk should go in before cereal, and 
that Lebron James is clearly better than Kobe Bryant; but it’s not a big deal if someone 
disagrees with me. So why is politics an exception? If friendships can only be formed 
between like-minded people, then democracy is in peril. Let us build that bridge. Jack 
and I did. It makes a difference. 
I have been blessed with so many fantastic friends. I was going to write about my best 
friend in this essay. But no friendship has taught me more than the one Jack and I 
share."
172,"I would chose to continue my involvement with Summer in the City, a nonprofit that 
empowers young citizens to revitalize Detroit through beautification and youth 
engagement, because I believe heavily in the power and potential of two things: Detroit 
and young people. 
At SITC, I can see the difference I’m making through the murals I paint and the kids I 
play with. With each brush stroke, I am moving the city one step in a positive direction. 
And with each high five from my “buddy” at the camp, I feel like I am part of the 
grassroots, youth-driven movement the city needs."
